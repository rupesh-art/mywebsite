        <h1 style="color: white;background-color: black;text-align: center;font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Jayadeva Goswami</h1>
            Shri Jayadeva Goswami was the court pandit of Shri Lakshman Sena, the 
King of Bengal. Jayadeva's father was Bhojadev, and his mother's name was 
Bamadevi. They lived in the Birbhum district of what is now West Bengal in a 
village called Kenubilva Gram. He was born at the beginning of the twelfth 
centrury AD. 
<br>
<br>
            Jayadeva Goswami's wife was named Shri Padmavati. When he was the 
court pandit of Laksman Sen, he lived on the banks of the Ganges. Approximately 
three hundred years before the appearance of Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Shri 
Jayadeva Goswami lived in Bengal. He was the author of Shri Gita Govinda, 
which is mentioned by  Krishnadas Kaviraja Goswami in the Chaitanya 
Charitamrita as follows (CC ML 2/11):
<br>
<br>
 "Day and night, in teh company of Svarupa Damodara and Ramananda Raya, Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu used to 
hear with great ecstasy the songs of Vidyapati and Chandidas, as well as a drama 
composed by Ramananda Raya. He also used to relish hearing the Krishna
Karnamrita and the Gita-Govinda.  In his introduction, Jayadeva says that the Gita 
Govinda is a scripture describing the intimate pastimes of Shri Radha and 
Govinda. It may be worshiped and served by those who are extremely qualified in 
devotional piety.  For those  who are constantly remembering the rasik pastimes of 
Shri Hari within his mind, Shri Jayadeva has composed this divine poetic song 
glorifying the Lord's internal pastimes. He requests the topmost spiritually 
advanced souls to hear it with gravity and attention. 
<br>
<br>
            There are many many traditional stories regarding the life of Shri 
Jayadeva.  The following story is generally accepted as authoritative.  One day, 
Shri Jayadeva Goswami was composing a particulary sensitive section of the Gita
Govinda, describing Krishna's relationship with the gopis headed by Radharani. 
He meditated deeply on what he had written and became  concerned that he had 
perhaps gone too far in describing the exalted character of the gopis. What he had 
written seemed to represent Krishna's position as being, in a sense, subordinate to 
that of the gopis.  And yet Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.  How 
could he be subordinate to the gopis? He had been inspired to pen a line stating 
that  Krishna bows down to touch the lotus feet of Shri Radha.  But his hand 
shrank from the page.  He hesitated thinking,  "How can I commit such an idea to 
writing? How can I have the audacity to put such a thing it in black and white?"  
At that time he decided to go bathe in the Ganges, in hopes that perhaps some 
inspiration would come to him. 
<br>
<br>
            Jayadeva Goswami went off to take his afternoon bath, leaving his wife 
Padmavati behind to cook the offering for the Deities.  While he was away, 
Krishna arrived at his house in the dress of Jayadeva. Krishna went over to 
Jayadeva's writing desk, and there found the sheaves of palm upon which the Gita
Govinda was written. Krishna picked up Jayadeva's pen and wrote the verse with 
the line  "dehi padapallava-mudaram," wherein it says "Krishna bows down his 
head to the lotus feet of Shri Radha." With this Krishna, disguised as Jayadeva, sat 
down and took the prasadam prepared by Padmavati.  After finishing his 
prasadam, Krishna stepped outside and vanished.  Just at that time, Jayadeva 
returned from bathing at the Ganges. When he asked about prasadam, his wife was 
perplexed. When she told Jayadeva what had just happened, Jayadeva was 
astonished. He was he went over to his book and saw there in wet ink the verse he 
had thought of writing before he had gone to bathe in the Ganges: dehi 
padapallavam udaram: Krishna bows down his head to the lotus feet of Shri 
Radha.  Upon seeing that verse he said to Padmavati, "It is a miracle! See here: 
what I told you I was reluctant to write has been written here exactly as I thought 
of it."  Tears of ecstasy flowed in rivers from his eyes as he understood the 
mystery of what had just transpired. "Padmavati!" he said, "You are most 
fortunate.  Krishna Himself has written the line, dehi padapallavam udaram, and 
accepted prasadam from your own hand."  
<br>
<br>       
            Shrila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has written that although Chandidasa, 
Vidyapati, Bilvamangala, and Jayadeva lived before Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu 
was externally manifest within this world, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's conception of 
bhakti had arisen within their hearts and was expresed in their writings.  Besides 
the Gita Govinda, Jayadeva Gowsami has written another book called 
Chandraloka.
<br>
<br>
            The famous Dasa-Avatara-Gita, describing the ten avatars of Vishnu is 
from Gita-Govinda.  Jayadeva Goswami's disappearance day is on Pausha
Sankranti. At present, at Jayadeva's birthplace in Kendubiva Gram, there is a 
festival every year on this day which is known as the Jayadeva Mela;

       <h1 style="color: white; background-color: black;text-align: center;font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Gadadhara Pandit</h1> 
            From the time that he was a boy, Gadadhara Pandita was always in the 
association of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Sri Gadadhara Pandita's father's name 
was Sri Madhava Misra; his mother's name was Sri Ratnavati Devi . They lived 
close to the house of Jagannatha Misra in Mayapura. Sri Ratnavati Devi looked 
upon Sacidevi as if Sacidevi were her big sister. The two of them were always 
spending time with each other. At the of his childhood pastimes, Gaurahari used to 
often play with Gadadhara Pandita. They both went to the village school together 
to study. Gadadhara Pandita was a year younger than Gaurahari. Gadadhara had so 
much affection for Gaurahari that he could not leave his company even for a 
moment.  
<br>
<br>
            In the Gaura-ganodesa-dipika it has been explained by Kavi Karnapura that 
in Vraja-lila Sri Gadadhara Pandita was the daughter of Vrsabhanu—Srimati 
Radharani.  This is confirmed in the notebooks of Svarupa Damodara as well as in 
the songs of Sri Vasudeva Ghosa Thakura. According to Sri Caitanya Caritamrta: 
“No one can describe the characteristics and ecstatic love of Gadadhara Pandita. 
Therefore another name for Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is Gadadhara Prananatha, 
“the life and soul of Gadadhara Pandita.” No one can say how merciful the Lord is 
to Gadadhara Pandita, but people know the Lord as Gadaira Gaura, “the Lord 
Gauranga of Gadadhara Pandita.”
<br>
<br>
            The Caitanya bhagavata records that when Isvara Puri stayed in 
Nabadwipa Mayapura, he lived at the house of Sri Gopinatha acarya for a few 
months. At that time, ^svara Puri was very affectionate towards Gadadhara and 
tutured him from his book Krsna-lilamrta. From his early childhood, Gadadhara 
Pandita was very serious and self-composed. He was peaceful, renounced, and 
fond of solitude.  On the other hand, in His childhood, Gaurasundara appeared to 
be very fickle, unsteady, and whimsical.  When they were studying in school, he 
would distrub Gadadhara with whimsical questions whose sophistry was meant to 
baffle Gadadhara. Gadadhara didn't like this as it disturbed his mind and his 
studies.  As a result he was forced to keep Gaurahari at a distance. But he couldn't 
bear to keep aloof from the Lord. This posed a great dilemma for Gadadhara 
Pandita. The Lord said, “Gadadhara! Soon I shall become such a great Vaisnava 
that even Brahma and Siva will come to me and bow down. 
<br>
<br>
            Sri Gadadhara Pandita was especially affectionate towards Mukunda Datta. 
Whenever sadhus  or sannyasis would come to Nabadwipa from somewhere, 
Mukunda Datta would tell Gadadhara and together they would go and visit that 
holy man.  One time, from Chattagrama, Pundarika Vidyanidhi came to 
Nabadwipa. At that time, Mukunda Datta intimated to Gadadhara that there was a 
Vaisnava worth seeing, and suggested they they go visit him. With great jubilation 
at the prospect of seeing a Vaisnava, Gadadhara Pandita went to visit Pundarika 
Vidyanidhi with Mukunda Datta. When Gadadhara Pandita came before 
Pundarika, he saw that he appeared to be a great materialist. His faith was 
somewhat damaged upon seeing this. He said to himself, “If he is a Vaisnava, why 
does he appear to be such a materialist?”
<br>
<br>
            Mukunda Datta, knowing the mind of Gadadhara, sweetly sang a verse 
about Krsna-lila. Mukunda Datta had known Pundarika Vidyanidhi, and by 
sweetly chanting this verse he awakened his  inner consciousness.  Hearing 
Mukunda Datta singing this verse about krsna-lila from Srimad-Bhagavatam he 
began crying “Krsna! Krsna!” and weeping again and again. The Caitanya
Bhagavata says that the flowing of tears from his eyes was as if the Ganges had 
descended.  Finally he fell upon the ground, and after rolling back and forth for 
some time lost consciousness. 
<br>
<br>
            Upon seeing this, Gadadhara Pandita felt great remorse within his mind.  
He began to reconsider his attitude toward Pundarika Vidyanidhi. He thought, “I 
thought that this great devotee, this mahabhagavata, was an ordinary sense 
enjoyer.  I have committed a great offense. If, however, I accept mantra initiation 
from him I may become free from this offense. I see no other way.”  In this way, 
Sri Gadadhara Pandita made up his mind to take initiation from Pundarika 
Vidyanidhi. 
<br>
<br>
            When Pundarika returned to his external consciousness, Mukunda Datta 
introduced Gadadhara Pandita to him. Hearing from Mukunda Datta about the 
character of Gadadhara Pandita, Pundarika was delighted. When he heard of 
Gadadhara's desire to become his disciple he was pleased. He smiled, saying, “I 
consider myself very fortunate. Only after many many births does one get a 
disciple like this.” Soon after this, one an auspicious day, Sri Gadadhara Pandita 
accepted mantra initiation from Pundarika Vidyanidhi. 
<br>
<br>
            After Caitanya Mahaprabhu returned from Gaya-dhama, he began his 
manifestations of Krsna-prema.  At Gaya, he had performed his pastime of taking 
shelter of ^svara Puri.  Once he returned home, he began a new life. Day and night 
he would float in the ocean of Krsna-prema.  Seeing Mahaprabhu's wonderful 
tears of ecstasy in Krsna-prema, Gadadhara found himself also overwhelmed with 
ecstasy.  He too cried tears of joy in divine love of Krsna.  From then on 
Gadadhara Pandita found it difficult to give up the Lord's association even for an 
hour.  One day, Gadadhara brought Mahaprabhu some tambula.  When he arrived 
at the house of the Lord, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was deeply absorbed in a mood 
of separation from Krsna.  Mahaprabhu said, “Gadadhara! Where is 
Syamasundara?  Where is that Lord of Vrndavana who is dressed in yellow 
cloth?” Saying this, the Lord began to weep.  Gadadhara was stunned and could 
not understand what answer to give. With great reverence, he humbly submitted, 
“Krsna is in your heart.”
<br>
<br>
            Upon hearing this Mahaprabhu began tearing at his chest, but Gadadhara 
quickly restrained His hands from doing any damage. The Lord said, “Gadadhara! 
Let go of my hands! If I cannot see Krsna I will not be able to maintain my life.”  
Gadadhara said, “If you just remain patient, Krsna will surely reveal Himself. He 
will surely come here before long.” With this Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was 
pacified. Seeing these pastimes of Gaura-Gadadhara from a little distance, 
Sacimata thought to herself with great satisfaction, “This boy Gadadhara is very 
intelligent.  I need not fear for Gaurahari's sake.” Sacimata said, “Gadadhara! You 
must always stay by the side of my son Gaurahari; in this way I shall not have to 
worry. 
<br>
<br>
            One day in the house of Suklambhara Brahmacari the Lord was to speak 
something about Krsna. Hearing this, Gadadhara went to the house of 
Suklambhara Brahmacari and took his seat within the house. Outside on the 
veranda the Lord began to speak. As the Lord spoke he became overwhelmed with 
ecstasy and went into a rasik trance. All the devotees surrounding him also began 
to swim in the waves of prema. In this way for some time everyone tasted prema
rasa. Gadadhara's prema could not have been more intense. Lowering his head he 
began loudly weeping again and again with tears of ecstasy.  Hearing Gadadhara's 
pitiful tears, Mahaprabhu said, “Who is that within the house who is weeping so 
intensely?“ Suklambhara Brahmacari said, “It is your Gadadhara.” The Lord said, 
“Gadadhara! You are most fortunate. From your early childhood you have been a 
determined devotee of Krsna. My own birth was useless. Because of all my sinful 
karma I could not  attain Krsna.” Saying this the Lord embraced Gadadhara in 
great ecstatic love.
<br>
<br> 
            When the Lord was performing his Nabadwipa-lila  his chief assistant was 
Gadadhara.  They who in Vrndavana are Radha-Krsna take the form of Gaura
Gadadhara in these pastimes in Nabadwipa on the banks of the Ganges.  And those 
who in Vrndavana are gopas and gopis take part in the pastimes of the Lord in 
Nabadwipa by performing kirtana. One day the Lord was wandering by the banks 
of the Ganges when he came upon a small forest grove and sat down. Gradually he 
became absorbed in remembering the Vrndavana pastimes. Mukunda Datta began 
sweetly singing songs in the purva-raga. Gadadhara, after gathering flowers in the 
forest decorated the Lord's neck with a garland. Just as formerly in Vrndavana, Sri 
Radha used to decorate Lord Krsna, inthe same way Gadadhara decorated the holy 
form of Lord Gauranga.  Someone sang a sweet song, someone performed a 
beautiful dance. At length Gauranga sat Gadadhara down on the root of a tree 
which served as a raised platform. Sri Advaita acarya performed the aroti to the 
two of them. Sri Nityananda Prabhu was seated on the left of them. Srivasa 
Pandita Prabhu was taking flowers and decorating them. Narahari was waving the 
camara. Suklambhara was offering candana. Murari Gupta was singing glories to 
the Lord. Madhava, Vasudeva, Pursottama, Vijaya, and Mukunda, as well as 
others sang different songs in various ragas. 
<br>
<br>
            In this way, the Lord finished his Nadiya-lila; he performed his sannyasa
lila and left his mother and his country and went to live in Jagannatha Puri. At that 
time Gadadhara Pandita followed Him and also went to Jagnnatha Puri, to live.  
There Gadadhara Pandita engaged himself in the service of the Sri Gopinatha 
deity. At that time the Lord would regularly go and visit his dear Gadadhara to 
float in the waves of rasa  by discussing Krsna. When the Lord made his 
pilgrimage to Vrndavana, he forbade Gadadhara Pandita to go with Him. At that 
time, his separation knew no bounds. 
<br>
<br>
            Gadadhara Pandita use to teach a Srimad-Bhagavatam class.  His eternal 
companion, Sri Gaurasundara used to sit and hear from him. Sri Gadadhara 
Pandita's discussion of Srimad-Bhagavatam was like an ocean of nectar. After the 
forty-eight years of the Lord's manifest pastimes were over, He disappeared into 
the Gopinatha deity of Gadadhara Pandita. This is recorded in Bhakti-ratnakara.
            Bhaktivinoda Thakura has written:
            <br>
 <h6 style="text-align: center;font: bold;">smara gaura gadadhara kelikalam

            Remember the wonderful pastimes of Gaura and Gadadhara. Become a

Gaura and Gadadhara, and worship Lord Gaura, the beautiful moon of the groves

       <h1 style="color: white; background-color: black;text-align: center;font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> Shri Abhirama Gopal Thakura</h1>
       <br>
       <br> Shri Abhirama Gopal Thakura  was also known as Shri Rama Das. He was 
a great devotee of Lord Nityananda.  On the order of Shri Nityananda Prabhu, he 
became a great acharya and preacher of Gaudiya Vaishnavism.He was a very 
influential personality, and atheists and blasphemers were very much afraid of 
him. Empowered by Shri Nityananda Prabhu, he was always in ecstasy and was 
kind to all fallen souls. It is siad that if he offered obeisances to any stone other 
than a shalagram-shila, it would immediately burst into pieces. According to 
Gaura-Ganodesha-Dipika  (12) in Krishna-lila he was Shridama, one of the 12 
prominent boy cowherd friends of Shri Krishna. He was Nityananda's dearmost 
devotee. Abhiram Gopal's wife's name was Shri Malini devi. 
<br>
<br>
        Abhirama Gopala Thakura lived in Khanakula Krishnanagara. Khanakula 
Krishanagar may be visited by taking the narrow gauge train from Howrah Station 
in Calcutta to Amta. It is located in the present Hooghly District of West Bengal.  
There, in Khanakula Krishnanagara, near the bankof the Khana river,  is the 
temple of Abhirama Thakura.  Because it is a town (nagara) with a Krishna 
temple, the town is called Krishna-nagara, and because the temple is on the kula 
(banks) of the Khana, it is called Khanakula-krishna nagara Just outside the temple 
is a bakula tree. This place is known as Siddha-bakula-kunja. It is said that 
Abhirama Thakura used to like sitting beneath this tree.  
<br>
<br>
        The story of how the Gopinath deity of Khanakula Krishnanagara was 
established is as follows. One day, the deity of Gopinatha appeared to Abhiram 
Gopal in a dream, and informed him that he wanted to manifest himself in 
Khanakula Krishnanagara. It is said that he was buried in the earth, and that in the 
dream he ordered Abhirama Gopal to excavate him and inaugurate his worship. 
Abhirama Gopal went to the place where the Lord had indicated he would be 
found, and began excavation. There, after digging for some time, he found the 
mind-enchanting deity of Shri Gopinatha.  The place where this discovery was 
made is now called Rama kunda, and there is a small lake there. The Bhakti 
Ratnakara says, "After having excavated the Gopinatha deity, all the devotees 
headed by Rama Dasa (Abhirama Gopala) bathed in the sacred waters of the 
kunda near the spot where the deity had been found.  From that day on the kunda 
became famous as Rama Kunda. Whoever bathes there becomes free from 
repeated birth and death."
<br>
<br>
        One day Shri Abhirama Gopala was overwhelmed with the ecstasy of 
sakhya rasa, and had a desire to play the flute of a cowherd boy.  Intoxicated by 
the bliss of Krishna-prema, he began searching the four directions for a suitable 
flute. As he searched through the forest for a suitable instrument all at once he saw 
before him a big log. The log was so huge that sixteen men could not move it. 
Grabbing hold of that log, he turned it into a flute and began to play upon it.  The 
Chaitanya Charitamrita says, "Rama dasa was one of the principle branches of the 
Nityananda branch of the Chaitanya tree of bhakti. He was full of sakhya
prema—love of Krishna saturated with the mellow of friendship. He once picked 
up a log that sixteen men couldn't lift and used it as a flute."  
<br>
<br>
        Shri Abhirama Thakura had a bullwhip that was imbued with divine 
power. Its name was "Jayamangal."  Whoever was struck with this whip became 
filled with Krishna prema.  One day Shrinivasa Acharya went to take darshan of 
Abhiram Gopala.  At that time, Abhiram Gopal touched him three times with 
Jayamangal. The Thakur's good wife, Malini, cried out, "My Lord! Do not touch 
him again. Calm yourself. Shrinivas is only a boy. If you touch him again he will 
lose consciousness." As a result of coming in contact with the whip of Abhirama 
Thakura, Shrinivasa Acharya became filled with Shri Krishna prema.
<br>
<br>
        When Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu ordered Nityananda Prabhu to preach in 
Bengal, he sent Abhirama Gopal and Gadadhara Das along with him. Simply upon 
seeing Abhiram Gopal, atheists and blasphemers would flee in terror. He was a 
remarkable scholar, well-versed in all the scriptures. He married his wife, Malini, 
upon the order of Shri Nityananda Prabhu.  His disappearance day is on the 
seventh day of the dark moon in the month of Chaitra, and on that day a great 
festival attended by thousands of devotees is held every year in Khanakula
Krishnanagara.

 “I worship Sripad Ramanuja, the incarnation of Ananta, who took birth in 
the month of Caitra (April-May) under the sixth lunar mansion in the Tundirades, 
and who came upon this earth to establish the philosophy of Sri Visnu.”
<br>
<br>
            Four major schools or sampradayas of Vaisnavism are considered 
authorized by Vaisnavas everywhere: the Brahma, Sri, Rudra, and Kumara 
Sampradayas. While Gaudiya Vaisnavas follow the disciplic line of Visnu worship 
originating with Brahma, Sripad Ramanujacarya is the founder-acarya of the Sri 
Sampradaya, the school of Vaisnavism or Visnu worship descending from the 
eternal consort of Visnu known as Laksmidevi or Sri.   His commentaries on 
Vedanta rival those of Sankaracarya, especially in Tamil-speaking South India, 
where Sri Vaisnavism is prominent to this day. He propounded the Vedantic 
philosophy known as Visistadvaita-vada, or qualified monism. The most famous 
among his numerous writings are his commentary on Vedanta (Sri Bhasya), his 
commentary on Bhagavad-gita, his Vedanta-Sara, and the Vedartha-Sangraha.
<br> 
<br>
            Many biographies of Ramanuja were compiled shortly after his passing, 
including the  Sanskrit Prappanamrtam of Anantacarya and various Tamil works. 
These authorized sources provide quite a detailed portrait  of  Ramanuja's life and 
teachings. Before we consider Ramanuja's importance in the development of  
Vaisnava philosophy and practice, however, we must first consider the South 
Indian Vaisnava traditions from which Ramanuja came and which influenced him.
<br>
<br>
 <h3 style="background-color: black; color: white; text-align: center;">THE PREVIOUS ACHARYAS</h3>
 <br>
 <h5 style="color: blue; text-align: center;">NATHAMUNI</h5>
 <br>
 <br>
            The first prominent acarya of the Sri Vaisnava school to formulate a 
systematic theology of devotion was Sri Nathamuni who appeared as the son of a 
scholarly South Indian brahmana in the year 908 A.D.  Nathamuni was the first 
important teacher to bring together the teachings of the Vedic Sanskrit texts and 
the ancient Tamil hymns of the Alwars, (South Indian saints who are famous as 
incarnations of the divine paraphernalia of Visnu, such as his disc, conch, lotus, 
wheel, garland and so on).  Nathamuni was responsible for compiling the “Tamil 
Vedas.”  These were a collection of prayers, devotional songs, and hymns to Visnu 
written by the Alwars in the Tamil language. These hymns, known as the 
Prabandha, are sung to this day before the deity of Visnu in the templeat Sri 
Rangam, the traditional headquarters of the Sri Vaisnavas and the most famous 
temple in South India.  At the end of his life, Nathamuni was the temple 
commander at the Sri Rangam temple.
<br>
<br>

            Nathamuni's son, Isvaramuni, died at an early age while his wife was still 
pregnant. Her child, Nathamuni's grandson later became famous as Yamunacarya, 
the direct  spiritual precursor of Ramanuja himself.  After the death of his own 
son, Nathamuni took sannyasa. Because of his vast learning, he was given the 
name “Muni” and because of his development in yogic perfection, he was famous 
as “Yogindra.” His systematic philosophy of Sri Vaisnavism is formulated in his 
treatise on logic, nyaya-tattva, and his views on the relationship between bhakti 
and mystic yoga are given in his book Yoga-rahasya.
<br>
<br> 
<h5 style="color: blue; text-align: center;">YAMUNACARYA</h5>
<br>
<br>
            After Nathamuni, Sri Yamunacarya was the foremost exponent of Sri 
Vaisnavism before Ramanuja. Born about 953 A.D. in Madura, the capital of the 
kingdom of Pandura, Yamuna was raised by his mother and grandmother, as his 
father had passed away and his grandfather, Nathamuni had taken sannyasa. 
Although he was an orphan, he did well in his studies and soon surpassed all his 
fellow students in scholarship.  The academic genius of the young Yamuna 
amazed everyone.  His attention to his studies and proficiency in the scriptures 
endeared him to his teacher, Sri Bhasyacarya and his sweet and beautiful nature 
made him the darling of his classmates. 
<br>
<br>
            When Yamuna was only twelve, he won a kingdom through the power of 
his wits.  At that time, the royal pandita of the Pandya king of Cola had succeeded 
in making all the other panditas in his country look like fools.  He was famous as 
“Vidvajjanakolahala” which means “One who throws scholars into an uproar.”  
The royal pandita was very dear to the king who patronized him lavishly.  
Vidvajjanakolahala used to extract an annual tax from all the panditas in the land.  
Those who didn't pay had to face the royal pandita in argument and be humiliated 
and subsuquently punished.  For fear of losing their reputation as scholars, 
everyone used to regularly pay this tax without argument. One day a disciple of 
the royal pandita arrived at the asrama of Yamuna's guru demanding the tax.  
Yamuna's guru was away at the time and Yamuna himself refused to pay the tax, 
considering it to be an insult to his gurudeva. He sent the disciple back with the 
message that an insignificant follower of Bhasyacarya would challenge the world
conquering royal pandita,  Vidvajjanakolahala in open debate. 
<br>
<br>
            When the news of the twelve-year old boy's challenge came to the royal 
pandita, he simply laughed.  “All right,”  he said.  “Summon this scholar here and 
let us match wits.”  By the king's own order a day was set for the debate, and at the 
appointed time the boy scholar was brought before the royal court on a lavish 
palanquin.  Seeing the boy's beauty, the queen was charmed. She instantly took his 
side, while the king favored his own pandita. A wager was settled on by the king 
and queen. If the king's pandita won the debate, the queen was to submit to the 
king's every whim.  If the queen's favorite, the beautiful boy pandita, won the 
debate, the king was to award Yamunacarya half the kingdom. 
<br>
<br>
            First the royal pandita examined the child, asking him many obscure 
questions about Sanskrit grammar which Yamuna answered perfectly.  Then it was 
Yamuna's turn to examine the scholar. 
<br>
 He said, “I will state three maxims.  If you 
can refute them, I shall admit defeat.  
<br>
The first is this: your mother is not barren.” 
            The royal pandita was dumbfounded.  To refute this maxim would be do 
deny his own birth. Unable to answer, he stood silent.
            Yamunacarya continued: “My second proposal is this: The king is 
righteous.  Refute this  if you dare.”
            Again the pandita was silenced.  How could he argue that his own king 
was impious?
            Finally the boy said: “My third proposal is this: The queen is chaste. 
Refute this and I am defeated.”
<br>
<br>
            Unable to refute these propositions, the pandita fought back.  “You are 
proposing things which are irrefutable. By asking me to challenge the piety of the 
king and the chastity of the queen you are committing treason and blasphemy.  
How dare you ask this of me!  This is an outrage. If you think these propositions 
can be refuted then refute them yourself and be damned as an offender to the 
throne.  Otherwise admit your insolence and hang your head in shame.”
<br>
<br>
            The panditas followers filled the arena with applause, and the king felt 
confident that his champion had successfully turned back the challenge of this 
impudent boy. But Yamunacarya was not  finished. “As you wish,” he said.  “I 
shall refute these propositions myself. First I asked to to refute the proposal that 
your mother is not barren. Since you have failed to do so, I must cite the Manu 
Smrti on this matter. According to the Laws of Manu, “If a woman has no more 
than one child, she may be considered barren.” (eka-putro hy aputrena lokavadat, 
Manu-Samhita, 9.61, Medhatithi Bhashya). Since your mother had only one son, 
the proposal that she is not barren is refuted. 
<br>
<br>
            “Now the second proposal: the king is pious.  I asked you to refute this, but 
you were unable to do so. The Laws of Manu also state that since he is responsible 
for their protection, the king assumes one sixth of the results  of the pious or 
impious deeds of his subjects. (sarvato dharmasad bhago rajo bhavati raksatah, 
adharmadapi sad bhago bhavatyasya hyaraksatah, Manu-Samhita, 8.304, 
Medhatithi Bhashya) Since this is Kali-yuga, the people in general are naturally 
impious, and so the king must assume a heavy burden of impiety. This refutes the 
second thesis: the king is pious.
<br>
<br>
            “As for my refutation to the third proposal—the queen is chaste.”  With 
this the crowd became quiet.  The queen herself blushed.  Yamunacarya's 
supporters wondered, how the boy could refute this proposition and conquer the 
pandita without embarrassing the queen.  Yamunacarya continued, “The Laws of 
Manu state that a great king is the representative of the gods.  The gods—Agni the 
fire-god, Vayu the wind-god, Surya the sung-god, Chandra the moon-god, Yama 
the lord of death, Varuna, Kuvera, and Indra—are all present in the body of the 
king.  The queen, therefore is wedded to more than just one man.  When a woman 
is married to more than one man how then can she be chaste? Thus the third 
proposition is refuted.”
<br>
<br>
            The crowd was astonished.  The boy scholar had certainly defeated the 
royal pandita. The queen was jubilant and embraced Yamunacarya, saying, 
“Alabandaru,” meaning “one who conquers.” The court pandita was disgraced. 
The king, who had been defeated in his wager with the queen, arose and said, “My 
boy, Alabandaru, child-scholar that you are you have defeated my royal pandita, 
the terror of scholars—Vidvajjanakolahola himself.  His pitiful life is now yours to 
do with as you see fit. I commend him into your hands.  As for yourself, I 
promised the queen to give you half my kingdom upon your victory here.  Now 
that you have won, I humbly request you to accept half my kingdom as your 
reward.”  The king awarded to Yamunacarya the place which is now called 
alavandara-medu. 
<br>
<br>
            Yamunacarya, who had won the title of “conqueror” now became famous 
as Alabandaru, the boy-king.  As the years passed, he became involved  more and 
more in the affairs of state, practically forgetting the legacy of his grandfather, 
Nathamuni.  Surrounded by kingly opulence and royal power, he gradually 
became entrenched in the position of a king. Absorbed in politics, he had little 
time for spiritual affairs. 
<br>
<br>
            About this time, Alabandaru's grandfather, Nathamuni, had passed away, 
but before he left this world, he called his most confidential disciple Nambi to his 
side and entrusted him with a sacred task: to inspire Yamunacarya to renounce his 
kingdom and champion the cause of Sri Vaisnavism.  Yamunacarya was uniquely 
qualified to propogate Sri Vaisnavism.  No one else could take the place of 
Nathamuni. 
<br>
<br>
            Years passed. Finally the time came to spur Yamunacarya to action. 
Nambi, remembering the order of his gurudeva set out to confront Yamunacarya 
and convince him of the need to renounce the world and preach. When he arrived 
at the palace gates, however, he was turned away.  It was not easy for a humble 
mendicant to get an interview with the great King Alabandaru. Through inquiry, 
Nambi came to know who the royal cook was.  One day, while the cook was 
returning from the marketplace with fresh produce, Nambi stopped him and gave 
him some vegetable greens called tuduvalai, which are supposed to promote 
mental purity and increase one's tendency towards contemplation and spiritual life. 
He asked to cook to please prepare these greens regularly for the welfare of the 
king.  The pious cook understood the rarity and purity of these greens and was 
pleased to cook them for the king.  From that day on, he began regularly preparing 
them for the king's lunch. The king very much enjoyed the greens, and Nambi 
would regularly supply the cook with them. 
<br>
<br>
            One day, Nambi held back. The king missed his greens and asked the cook 
why they had not been prepared.  When the cook explained about the mysterious 
mendicant who supplied these greens, the king's interest was piqued. “The next 
time this sadhu comes,” the king ordered his royal cook, “bring him before me.” 
<br>
<br>
            The next day, when Nambi returned with the greens, the cook brought him 
before the king and introduced him. “What do you want of me?” the king asked.  
“Why do you bring these greens every day for no payment?” Nambi requested a 
private audience.  The king ordered all his attendants to leave them alone, and 
when everyone had gone he offered Nambi a seat. “Please speak,” he said.
<br>
            Nambi then told Alabandaru of his grandfather's passing. He told him of 
Sri Nathamuni's anxiety that the sampradaya of Sri Vaisnavism needed a 
champion, a great scholar who could defeat opposing schools of philosophy and 
establish the religious principles of their tradition.  Only Yamunacarya was 
qualified enough to do this, but he had now become King Alabandaru, a ruler of 
men attached to royal luxury and power.  Gradually Nambi awoke in 
Yamunacarya's heart a desire to renounce the throne and lead the Sri Sampradaya. 
After deeply considering the message of Bhagavad-gita in Nambi's company he 
visited the temple of Sri Rangam, where he accepted the mantra from Nambi and 
committed himself to giving up the opulence of royalty and taking up the mission 
of his grandfather. 
<br>
<br>
            After surrendering himself fully to a life of spiritual discipline, 
contemplation and devotion, Sri Yamunacarya went on to become a great teacher.  
He quickly became the intellectual and spiritual leader of the Sri Vaisnavas, highly 
regarded for his realization, his scholarship, and his synthesis of Nathamuni's 
system of philosophy with the system of Pancaratra worship ordained by the 
Vedas. Yamunacarya's unquestioned status as a brahmana helped him to establish 
his Pancaratrik version of Vedanta above the protests of the followers of 
Sankaracarya.  Thus he increased the prestige of Vaisnavism and Krsna-bhakti by 
demonstrating  both its scriptural basis and its spiritual superiority to mundane 
casteism.  Among his writings are the famous devotional prayers to Visnu known 
as the Stotra-ratnam, the Jewel of Prayers.  His writings  also include various 
philosophical and theological works: the Gita-sangraha, an explanation of his 
views on Bhagavad-gita; his Agama-pramanya, expounding the synthesis of the 
Pancaratra tradition with his version of Vaisnava Vedanta; and other important 
doctrinal works, such as the Siddhitraya or Threefold Perfection (of which only 
fragments survived him) and the Atma-siddhi, or Treatise on Self-realization.
<br>
<br>
            Yamunacarya's principle writings are in Sanskrit.  Writing in Sanskrit  was 
for Yamunacarya somewhat of a strategic departure from the tradition of the South 
Indian Alwars, who wrote in Tamil.  By writing his scriptural commentaries in 
Sanskrit, however, Yamunacarya hoped to establish the South Indian tradition  
within a more classic framework of exposition acceptable to a wider range of 
Vedic scholars.  In this way, he laid the groundwork for Ramanuja to establish Sri 
Vaisnavism as an orthodox sampradaya, or major school of theology. 
<br>
<br>
            The general outline of Sri Vaisnavism, as well as many of its details were 
chalked out by Yamunacarya in his writings.  It remained for Ramanuja to fill in 
that outline, to etch out its  finer details, to establish a more orthodox Sri 
Vaisnavism in the collective consciousness of South India, and to build a place in 
history for the Sri Vaisnava sampradaya.  
<br>
<br>
            Yamunacarya attracted many followers and disciples; history records the 
names of only twenty of them.  Although they were sincere and devoted to their 
beloved gurudeva, none of them were blessed with the deep scholarship or 
determined energy required to carry on his great work in a significant way.  It was 
left to Sri Ramanujacarya to fulfill Yamunacarya's hopes for the future of Sri 
Vaisnavism. 
<br>
<br>
            Periya Tirumalai Nambi, who is also called Sri Saila Purna in some 
accounts, was Yamunacarya's favorite follower. Under the guidance of 
Yamunacarya, he accepted the renounced order of life and lived with his guru, 
serving him to the very end. Nambi had two sisters, named Bhudevi and Sridevi, 
after the two consorts of Lord Sri Venkatesvara. Bhudevi married a pious 
brahmana named Asuri Kesavacarya. Kesavacarya lived in Sri Perumudura, about 
twenty-six miles from Madras. After some time, a child was born to them. He was 
named Laksmana by Nambi, after Laksmana, the brother of Sri Ramacandra. 
According to Sri Vaisnavas, Ramanuja was an incarnation of Laksmana himself.  
Since Laksman had been a great devotee of Rama the boy soon became known as 
Rama-anuja, or “follower of Rama.” 
<br>
<br>
            According to Sri Vaisnava tradition, Ramanuja was born on the fifth day of 
the full moon in the month of Caitra in 1017 A.D. Ramanuja's family belonged to 
the caste of Vadama smarta-brahmanas, who were formal Vedic scholars.  
Ramanuja's father Kesavacarya was very much attached to the performance of 
Vedic sacrifices or yajnas. For this reason he became famous as Sarvakratu or the 
performer of all kinds of sacrifices.  When the boy came of age, Kesavacarya 
immersed him in Sanskrit education, teaching him grammar, logic, and the Vedas. 
Although Ramanuja was well-schooled in brahminical learning, however, he had 
not yet been exposed to the deeply devotional Tamil hymns glorifying Sri Visnu.  
Still, his natural devotion had already been awakened by association with a non
brahmana disciple of Sri Yamunacarya named Kancipurna, and Ramanuja 
demonstrated a saintly nature even from his early childhood.  As time passed he 
underwent all the purificatory rites of a pious Hindu, including the sacred thread 
ceremony and was married, at the age of sixteen.  
<br>
<br>  
            Only a month after the wedding, Ramanuja's father became gravely ill and 
passed away.  After the passing of his father, Ramanuja moved along with his 
family to Kancipuram, where he entered the academy of Yadava Prakasa, a 
Vedantist of the impersonalist Sankarite school.  According to some 
commentators, the decision to enroll Ramanuja in the school of a non-Vaisnava is 
evidence that his family was not strictly devoted to Visnu but were merely caste 
brahmanas interested in insuring that their son would become a good scholar.  
Others are convinced that this was merely Ramanuja's strategy  to become well
versed in the arguments of Sankaracarya before thoroughly refuting them in his 
own commentaries.
<br>
<br>
            Ramanuja soon excelled among the students of Yadava Prakasa and 
become his teacher's  favorite student.  Yadava Prakasa preached the theory of 
nondualism, and stressed the illusion of all form, including the form of Sri Visnu.  
As Ramanuja's devotion to Visnu blossomed, his disgust with this philosophy 
grew. Still, out of respect for his teacher he avoided conflict. 
<br>
<br>
            Soon, however, the day arrived when he could no longer tolerate the 
impersonalism of Yadava Prakasa. One day Ramanuja was massaging his guru's 
back as Yadava Prakasa explained a verse from the Candogya Upanisad.  The 
verse contained the words kapyasam pundarikam evam aksini.  Following the 
interpretation of Sankaracarya, Yadava Prakasa explained that kapy means 
“monkey”  and asanam means “ass.” The verse therefore, as interpreted by Yadava 
Prakasa was translated to mean, “Lord Visnu's lotus eyes are as red as a monkey's 
ass.”

            Ramanuja was enraged at this blasphemy, and the hot tears flowed which 
from his eyes in anguish fell upon his guru's back. Yadava Prakasa could 
understand that his disciple was disturbed, and inquired as to what the problem 
was. When Ramanuja took issue with his guru's interpretation, Yadava Prakasa 
was astonished. He demanded Ramanuja's interpretation.  Ramanauja explained 
that kapyasam means “that which sits upon the water and flourishes by 
drinking,”—in other words, a lotus.  So the meaning of the verse is that the lotus 
eyes of Visnu are as beautiful as the red lotus which blossoms in the water.”
<br>
<br>
            When Yadava Prakasa saw his disciple's expertise in defeating his 
argument, he knew that he had a powerful rival in his midst.  From that day on, he 
began plotting Ramanuja's murder.  He conspired with his disciples to go on 
pilgrimage to the Ganges and kill Ramanuja in a secluded place.  After killing 
Ramanuja, they would bathe in the Ganges to expiate the sin.  Fortunately, 
Ramanuja's cousin learned of the murder plot and warned Ramanuja, who 
managed to escape unharmed. After some time Yadava Prakasa returned to 
Kancipurnam, and Ramanuja continued going to his lectures, although inwardly 
he was looking for another path. 
<br>
<br>
            At Yamunacarya himself went to vist Ramanuja, but when he came to 
Kanci he saw that Ramanuja was still a follower of Yadava Prakasa and so 
Yamunacarya did not approach him.  It is said that Yamunacarya watched him 
from a distance and prayed for Ramanuja to become the darsana-pravartaka, or 
philosophical preceptor of the Sri Vaisnava Sampradaya. 
<br>
<br>
            About this time, the king of Kancipuram called for Yadava Prakasa.  His 
daughter was possessed by a brahma-raksasa, a brahmana ghost.  Yadava Prakasa 
was called as an exorcist, and when he arrived with his disciples, he was brought 
before the king's daughter and asked to relieve her of the influence of the ghost.  
Speaking through the girl's mouth, the ghost insulted Yadava Prakasa and laughed 
at him. Ramanuja was asked to try, and when he came before the girl, the 
brahmana ghost said, “If Ramanuja blesses me with the dust of his lotus feet, I 
shall leave this girl.” Ramanuja did so upon which the girl was cured, and the king 
was deeply indebted to him.  
<br>
<br>
            After this humiliation before Ramanuja, it was not long before Yadava 
Prakasa told Ramanuja to leave his  asrama. The final split between them came 
when Yadava Prakasa was discussing the meaning of two Upanisadic texts: 
saravam khalv idam brahma (Candogya Upanisad 3.1, “everything is Brahman”) 
and neha nanasti kincana (Katha Upanisad 4.11, “there is no distintion”).  Yadava 
Prakasa discussed these verses at length while explaining the theory of oneness 
promoted by Sankaracarya with great eloquence.  After Yadava Prakasa was 
finished speaking, Ramanuja gave his own interpretation.
<br>
<br>
              Ramanuja explained that sarvam khalv idam brahman would mean “the 
whole universe is Brahman, if it were not for the word tajjalan in the next part of 
the verse, which qualifies the meaning.  Ramanujacarya held that the means not 
that the universe is Brahman, but that it is pervaded by Brahman. From Brahman 
the universe  comes, by Brahman it is sustained, and into Brahman it ultimately 
enters, just as a fish is born in water, lives in water, and is ultimately dissolved 
into water.  Still a fish is not water, but a separate entity entirely.  In the same way  
the universe, although existing within Brahman is different from Brahman. Just as 
a fish can never be water, so the universe can never be Brahman.  As to the second 
verse, neha nanasti kincana, according to Ramanuja it does not mean “No 
distinction exists,” but rather that things are not distinct in that they are are all 
interconnected, just as pearls are strung on a thread.  Since all things are inter
related and inter-connected, in a certain sense it may be said that there is no 
distinction to be made between them.  All things are related to Brahman and as 
such do not have any existence which is distinct from Brahman.  Still, while a 
certain unity can be seen in the inter-relatedness of all things, everything within 
the universe has its own distinct reality. Pearls strung on a thread have unity; 
collectively they form an organic whole, a necklace.  Still, each individual pearl 
has its own unique qualities.  While spirit, matter, and God may be seen as one 
organic whole, still all of them have their unique qualities.  Therefore, Ramanuja 
argued,  the principle of absolute oneness as argued by Sankaracarya cannot stand; 
rather the principle of unity characterized by different qualities must be accepted.
<br>
<br>
            After leaving Yadava Prakasa, Ramanuja was advised by his mother to 
take guidance from Kancipurna, the non-brahmana Vaisnava whose devotion 
Ramanuja greatly revered. Kancipurna advised him to serve the Visnu diety in the 
temple of Lord Varada by carrying water every day to the temple.  He began 
serving Kancipurna with great devotion, and soon was accepted as his disciple.  
Although Kancipurna was by birth a member of the sudra caste and  
Ramanujacarya was a brahmana, this never influenced  Ramanujacarya's devotion 
for him.  He accepted Kancipurna as his guru without reservation.   
Ramanujacarya's wife, however, could not tolerate her husband's acceptance of a 
sudra as a guru, and did her best to discourage  Ramanujacarya from remaining in 
his company.
<br>
<br>
            Yamunacarya by this time was very old.  Wracked by illness, he was on 
the verge of passing from this world when he heard that  Ramanujacarya had left 
the school of Yadava Prakasa and had begun serving the humble Kancipurna, who 
was famous as a great devotee of Visnu. He sent some disciples to bring  
Ramanujacarya.  When  Ramanujacarya heard the news, he immediately set out 
for Sri Rangam, the headquarters of the Sri Vaisnavas, where Yamunacarya lay 
dying.  But by the time he arrived at the side of Yamunacarya it was too late.  The 
master had passed from this world, entering Vaikuntha and the eternal service of 
Sri Visnu. 
<br>
<br>
            At that time,  Ramanujacarya noticed that three fingers on the right hand of 
the master were closed.  He asked the disciples of Yamunacarya if he had been 
accustomed to hold his hand in such a way, and they replied that it was highly 
unusual.  Sripad Ramanuja could understand that this unusual gesture of the three 
clenched fingers represented the three unfulfilled wishes of Yamunacarya. He then 
vowed to fulfill these three wishes.  He promised to teach the people in general the 
religion of surrender to Visnu, training them in the five samskaras, or purificatory 
processes. As he did so, one of Yamunacarya's fingers relaxed.   Ramanujacarya 
then vowed to comment on the hymns of the Alvars, the South Indian saints, and 
with this the second finger relaxed.  Finally Ramanujacarya promised to write a 
scholarly commentary on the Vedanta-sutras expounding the principles of Sri 
Vaisnavism as the ultimate truth of the Vedas. With this the last clenched finger 
was relaxed.  A look of spiritual peace came over the lotus face of  
Ramanujacarya's divine master, Sri Yamunacarya, as if to say that he could now 
depart peacefully, knowing that his mission was in good hands. 
<br>
<br>
            Upon his return to Kancipurna,  Ramanujacarya gradually became 
completely disinterested in his family life, his beautiful wife and home, and 
absorbed himself deeply in the service of his guru Kancipurna with whom he 
began spending most of his time.  As  Ramanujacarya spent more time at the 
temple, his wife became unhappy that her husband was ignoring her.  She was 
further humiliated by the fact that he was neglecting her to serve a low-born sudra. 
<br>
<br>
            One day,  Ramanujacarya invited Kancipurna for dinner, thinking that by 
so doing he would be able to take the remnants of his guru's  prasada, and so 
become blessed. Kancipurna, being very humble arived early, before Ramanuja 
returned home.  Kanipurna explained to Ramanuja's wife Kambalaksa that he had  
service to do in the temple and could not stay for long.  With this, Kambalaksa 
quickly fed him and sent him away.  After Kancipurna had left, she took a long 
stick and carefully picked up the banana leaf upon which he had dined, so as not to 
soil her hands with what she thought to be the contaminated remnants of an 
untouchable.  After ordering her maidservant to clean the room carefully, she 
bathed in order to purify herself. When Ramanuja returned and heard of the insult 
to his guru, he was enraged.
<br>
<br>
            One day, while drawing water from a well,  Ramanujacarya's wife met the 
wife of his guru, Kancipurna. When the water from their waterpots accidentally 
became mixed,  Ramanujacarya's wife cursed Kancipurna's wife, thinking that her 
waterpot had become contaminated by the water of an outcaste. Whend 
Ramanujacarya came to know of this insult, he was furious.  He sent his wife 
home to her parents and left to take sannyasa.
<br>
<br>
            After leaving home, he went to the temple of Varadraja to see the beloved 
deity of Visnu whome he had served for so long. After obtaining saffron cloth and 
all the necessary paraphernalia of the renounced order, he accepted the triple staff, 
(tridanda) of the Vaisnava sannyasi, symbolizing the complete surrender of mind, 
body, and words to Visnu.  With this, he became known as Yatiraja, “the king of 
the renounced order.”
<br>
<br>
            Soon after taking sannyasa,  Ramanujacarya established his own monastery 
or asrama, where he began training disciples in his systematic Vaisnava 
interpretation of Vedanta as well as  in the path of devotion to Visnu. His asrama 
was established near the temple in Kanci. His first disciple was his older sister's 
son, his nephew Mudali andan, also known as Dasarathi.  His second disciple was 
a learned and wealthy brahmana named Kurattalvan, also known as Kuresa, who 
was renowned for his photographic memory. 
<br>
<br>
            One day the mother of Yadava Prakasa saw  Ramanujacarya teaching his 
disciples and was impressed by his saintly qualities.  She was a great devotee of 
Visnu and was somewhat unhappy that her son, Yadava Prakasa had become a 
follower of Sankaracarya's impersonal monism. She encouraged Yadava Prakasa 
to visit  Ramanujacarya.  That night Yadava Prakasa had a dream in which a 
divine voice instructed him to become  Ramanujacarya's disciple. The next day,  
upon visiting  Ramanujacarya, Yadava Prakasa found him wearing the dress of a 
Vaisnava.  He asked him, “Why have you rejected the school of Sankaracarya? 
Why have you adopted this Vaisnava dress? Where is this sanctioned in the 
scriptures? Can you show any scriptural evidence supporting your behavior?”
            With this,  Ramanujacarya instructed his foremost disciple, Kuresa, to 
enlighten Yadava Prakasa with the scriptural evidence in support of Vaisnava 
dress. He quoted extensively from the Sruti, saying, “Sruti is the best evidence. 
Therefore I shall cite some references from the Sruti.
            In the Sruti it is said:
 <br>
            <h3 style="text-align: center;font: bold;">sa te visnorabja-cakre pavitre <br>
                janmambodhim tartave carnaninra <br>

                linganyamge tavakanyarpayanti</h3>
                <br>
            “To free themselves from the ocean of repeated birth and death, the best of 
men decorate their bodies with the symbols of the lotus and cakra of Visnu. 
<br>
<br>
 <h3 style="text-align: center;font: bold;" >aibhirbayamurukramasya cihnai rahnkita loke subhaga bhavamah <br>
    tad visno paramam padam ye'dhigaccanti lacchata </h3>
    <br>
            “Just as those who go to the holy abode of Visnu are decorated with the 
conch, lotus, disc, and club, so shall we also wear these marks and thus attain that 
divine abode.
<br>
<br>
 <h3 style="text-align: center; font: bold;">upavit-adi-baddharyah sanka-cakradayas tatha <br>
    brahmanasya visesena vaisnavasya visesatah</h3>
    <br>
            “Brahmanas should not only wear the sacred thread, but they should also 
decorate their bodies with the conch, lotus, cakra, and club of Visnu,thus 
identifying themselves as  Vaisnavas.
<br>
<h3 style="text-align: center;font: bold;">hare padakrtim atmano hitaya madhye cchidram-urdhva-purndram
    yo dharayati sa parasya priyo bhavati sa punyavan bhavati sa muktiman bhavati</h3> 
    <br>

            “One who decorates himself with the tilaka markings resembling the lotus 
feet of Visnu with a space in the middle becomes dear to the Paramatma, becomes 
pious,  and attains liberation.”
<br>
            After hearing Kuresa expound so perfectly the scriptural evidence for 
adopting the dress of a Vaisnava, Yadava Prakasa asked him, “Why do you say 
that Brahman has qualities ?  This view (visistadvaita-vada) is not supported by 
Sankaracarya.  Where is the scriptural evidence for your position?
<br>
            Agin Kuresa replied, citing the Sruti:
 <h3 style="text-align: center;font: bold;">yah sarvajnah sarvavit</h3> 
 <br>
            “[The qualities of the Supreme Absolute Truth are that] He is all-wise and 
omniscient.’
<br>
 His qualities are further described in the Upanisads as follows:
 <h3 style="text-align: center; font: bold;">na tasya karyam karanans ca vidyate <br>
    na tat samas cabhyadhikas ca drsyateæ <br>
    parasya saktir-vividhaive-sruyate <br>
    svabhaviki jnana-bala-kriya ca</h3>
    <br>
            “He does not possess bodily form like that of an ordinary living entity: He 
has a transcendental form of bliss and knowledge, and thus there is no difference 
between His body and His soul.  All His senses are transcendentally divine. He is 
absolute substance. Any one of His senses can perform the action of any other 
sense. Nothing is greater than Him or equal to Him. His potencies are 
multifarious, and thus His deeds are automatically performed as a natural 
consequence of His divine will. In other words , whatever He wills immediately 
becomes reality.  His divine energies are threefold: His knowledge (jnana-sakti) 
energy (also known as cit-sakti or samvit-sakti), His strength energy (bala-sakti, 
also known as the Lord's existence energy, sat, or sandhini-sakti), and his pastime 
(kriya-sakti) energy (also known as his ecstasy energy, ananda or hladini-sakti)."
<br>

 <h3 style="text-align: center; font: bold;">harih parayanam param harih parayanam param <br>
    punah punarvadamyaham harih parayanam param</h3>
    <br>
            “The Supreme Personality of Godhead is Sri Hari.  He alone is the ultimate 
shelter, the supreme refuge, the final resting place. Again and again I proclaim this 
fact: Sri Hari is the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
<br>
<br>
            In this way, Kuresa went on and on, citing one scriptural evidence after the 
next to establish the principles of Sri Vaisnavism. Yadava Prakasa was astounded 
at the profound scholarship of this disciple of  Ramanujacarya.  Remembering his 
mother's advice to take shelter of Ramanuja, remembering the divine voice in the 
dream that told him to surrender to  Ramanuja, and remembering all the offenses 
he had committed at the holy feet of that great saint, Yadava Prakasa could contain 
himself no longer.  He fell at the feet of  Ramanujacarya and prayed for his 
blessings. He submitted himself as a disciple of Ramanuja, who immediately 
accepted him, giving him the name Govinda Jiyar.
<br>
<br>
            Yadava Prakasa later became a famous disciple of  Ramanujacarya.  He 
freed himself from his attachment to the impersonal monism of Sankaracarya. 
After taking sannyasa, he used his great powers of scholarship to promote the 
cause of  Ramanujacarya and Sri Vaisnavism. He was no longer a proud scholar; 
now he was a humble devotee. In his final years,  he was ordered by Ramanuja to 
write a book on the proper religious conduct to be followed by Vaisnava sannyasis 
of the Sri Vaisnava line.  This book is called Yati-dharma-sammuccaya, and is still 
studied and followed by the sannyasis of  the Sri sampradaya.
<br>
<br>
            As Ramanuja's fame spread, the disciples of Yamunacarya in Sri Rangam 
begged Ramanuja to come and lead them.  Finally, after taking permission from 
his beloved deity Lord Varada, Ramanuja left Kancipuram for Sri Rangam, to 
begin his new life.
<br>
<br>
            After arriving in Sri Rangam,  Ramanujacarya immersed himself in 
studying the scriptures under the guidance of Mahapurna, a prominent disciple of 
Yamunacarya. With the help of Mahapurna,  Ramanujacarya became expert in 
many scriptures, including the Nyasatattva, the Gitartha-sangraha, the Siddhitraya, 
the Brahma-Sutra, and the Pancaratras. After some time Mahapurna advised  
Ramanujacarya to go to the great Goshtipurna and accept initiation in the 
Vaisnava mantra from him. 
<br>
<br>
            At the behest of Mahapurna, Ramanuja approached Goshtipurna for the 
mantra, but was refused, for Goshtipurna was reluctant to give such a confidential 
mantra to a relative newcomer.   Ramanujacarya approached Goshtipurna 18 times 
with great humility, finally breaking into tears and pleading for his mercy.  At last 
Goshtipurna gave him the mantra, after first swearing him to absolute secrecy.  
When Ramanuja had vowed never to repeat the mantra to anyone else, 
Goshtipurna whispered the mantra in his ear saying, “This mantra is most 
powerful. Whoever chants it will attain liberation; he will return to the spiritual 
Vaikuntha planets where he will achieve the personal service of the Lord.”
<br>
<br>
            As he left the temple and proceeded towards Sri Rangam, a crowd gathered 
around  Ramanujacarya. They had heard that he was to receive the mantra from 
Goshtipurna, and begged to know its secret. Inspired to distribute the magic of the 
mantra that could free anyone who chants it from material existence, Ramanuja 
announced to the crowd: “Please chant this mantra: Om namo narayanaya.”
<br>
<br>
            The crowd was overjoyed, and felt that they had been truly blessed, but 
when the news reached Goshtipurna, he called for Ramanuja.  Outraged that his 
new disciple would disobey his order so quickly, he demanded an explanation.  “I 
told you to keep this mantra a secret.  Why have you so quickly revealed it to the 
masses? Do you know the penalty for such behavior?” 
<br>
<br>
            Ramanuja replied, “Yes, gurudeva,  I may go to hell for disobeying your 
order.“
<br>
            “Then why have you done such a thing?”
            <br>
            “ My beloved teacher,  I realized that the power of the mantra given by you 
could deliver everyone who hears it.  When I saw the earnest desire of these 
people to be saved from material life, I could not contain myself.  I felt some 
divine inspiration to distribute your mercy to all of them.  If this is a great sin, then 
I must be punished by your holiness. Condemn me to hell, then, if my sin warrants 
it. But please do not show your wrath to these simple people who begged me for 
the mantra.”
<br>
<br>
            When Goshtipurna saw the earnest sincerity of his disciple, his heart was 
moved.  After all, what greater principle can there be than the distribution of the 
Lord's mercy. Although Ramanuja had disobeyed the letter of his instructions 
about the mantra,  he had understood the real spirit of the mantra itself.  He would 
make a great preacher of the Sri sampradaya, and had shown that he had the 
capacity to instill devotion in the hearts of the people in general.  How could he 
then be condemned? 
<br>
<br>
            Goshtipurna fell at Ramanuja's feet, saying, “Forgive me, my child.  It is 
you who are my master, and I the disciple. Who am I to take the role of your guru? 
How could I know your greatness? Accept me as your disciple.”
<br>
<br>
            After this incident,  Ramanujacarya's reputation spread far and wide.  He 
was regarded as an incarnation of Laksmana himself. He began training more and 
more disciples, and his camp grew.  He engaged many scholars in debate and 
defeated them by propounded his sytematic view of Vedanta, known as 
Visistadvaita-vada, or qualified monism.  One such scholar was Yajnamurti.
<br>
<br>
            Yajnamurti was a famous pandita who had defeated many scholars in 
argument and had written many commentaries on the scriptures. He challenged 
Ramanuja to a debate saying that if he lost, he would carry Ramanuja's shoes and 
become his disicple. Ramanuja, for his part, declared that if he was defeated, he 
would give up books and arguments forever. The debate began and went on for 17 
days.  Ramanuja was discouraged.  He prayed fervently to Lord Varada, his 
beloved Deity, for help.  That night he had a dream in which the Deity assured him 
of victory, advising him to follow the line of reasoning given by Yamunacarya.  
Uplifted by his divine vision, Ramanuja appeared in the arena of debate with 
renewed confidence.  Before the debate began, however, Yajnamurti surrendered 
himself to the holy feet of  Ramanujacarya, saying, “You are my master. You are 
glowing with the confidence of one who is in connection with divinity.  I realize 
now that it is futile to argue with you.  Please accept me.”
<br>
<br>
            From that day on, Ramanuja's reputation increased. During this time, he 
toured India with his disciples, traveling as far north as Kashmir, where he 
consulted the commentary of Bodhayana on the Vedanta Sutras.  Ramanuja was 
also a great advocate of proper Deity worship and had a habit of reforming the 
system of worship wherever he went.  In this way, he standardized the system of 
worship throughout the Vaisnava temples of India, eliminating many of the 
practices of nonVaisnavas that had become traditional.  His system was not, 
however, greeted with much enthusisam in Jagannatha Puri, where worship is 
performed according to the system of raga-marga, or spontaneous devotion. It is 
said that after he attempted to reform the system of Deity worship there, Lord 
Jagannatha became disturbed.  One night, as Ramanuja slept, he was transported 
by the power of Jagannatha to Kurmasthan.  When he awoke, he thought he had 
committed a great offense to Visnu.  Mistaking the deity of Kurma for a Siva
lingam, he thought that Visnu had thrown him into a Siva temple.  When at last he 
realized that it was a temple of Lord Kurma, Ramanuja set about reforming the 
deity worship there.
<br>
<br>
             After this, Ramanuja wrote the Sri-Bhasya, his commentary on Vedanta, 
and his fame spread still further.  The king of Cola, who was a great follower of 
Siva, sent a petition to all the famous scholars of South India, demanding their 
signature.  The petition declared Siva to be the supreme.  Many scholars signed, 
but Ramanuja refused.  When this came to the king's attention, he arranged to 
abduct Ramanuja, who managed to escape with the help of his devoted follower, 
Kuresa.  They exchanged garments, and Ramanuja, disguised as a householder, 
slipped through the guards that surrounded his camp. Meanwhile the king's 
soldiers arrested Kuresa, who had put on the sannyasa dress of Ramanuja.  This 
king was the same king whose daughter was saved from a ghost by Ramanuja.  
When Kuresa was dragged before the king in the dress of Ramanuja, the king 
demanded that he glorify Siva as the supreme.  Kuresa refused.  Because 
Ramanuja had helped the king's daughter, the king  decided to be lenient.  He told 
his servants not to kill their prisoner, but merely to put his eyes out for refusing to 
see the superior position of Siva.  After Kuresa was released, his eyesight was 
restored by a miracle. The king however, did not fare so well.  He developed a 
black boil on his neck and died. Henceforth that king became famous as “Krmi
kantha,” or worm-throat, because of the infection that killed him.
<br>
<br>
            Meanwhile, Ramanuja delivered many thousands of people to the cause of 
Sri Vaisnavism and established many temples. He traveled through what is now 
Madurai and Mysore, converting many Jains on his way.  At one point he defeated 
one thousand Jains in argument, after which they committed suicide rather than 
become Vaisnavas. 
<br>
<br>
            Ramanuja was merciful not only to those in the renounced order, but also 
to those surrendered grhasthas who had given their lives to his mission. One such 
grhastha was Dhanurdasa. When he met Ramanuja, Dhanurdasa was very much 
attached to his beautiful wife.  One day, Ramanuja asked him if he wanted to see a 
real beauty, and out of curiosity, Dharnurdasa agreed.  Ramanuja took him to the 
temple of Narayana and made him behold the beauty of the deity.  Upon realizing 
that the Lord's beauty eclipses all beauties of this world, Dhanurdasa became a 
great devotee and follower of Ramanuja. 
<br>
<br>
            Dhanurdasa was an example of detachment.  To teach detachment to one 
of his disciples, Ramanuja once staged the following demonstration. He had one 
of his disciples go to the place where the sannyasis bathed to switch their clothes, 
so that after bathing there would be some confusion.  When the sannyasis,  who 
were all renowned scholars and renunciants, were finished bathing, they found that 
their clothes had been exchanged.   One swami was wearing the cloth of another, 
and so an argument ensued. As one after another finished his bath and went to find 
his clothes, the argument grew more heated.  In this way, these great scholars of 
renunciation were seen to be attached to some simple pieces of cloth.
<br>
<br>
            Then Ramanuja sent his disciple to the home of Dhanurdasa, after first 
arranging for Dhanurdasa to serve in the temple, thus making sure that he would 
not be at home. The disciple went to the home of Dhanurdasa in the evening, and, 
following Ramanuja's orders began stealing the jewelry from the body of 
Dhanurdasa's wife. After stripping the ornaments from one side of her body, the 
disicple was about  to go when suddenly she turned over in her sleep.  The disciple 
was shocked and left through the window immediately.  Ramanuja had instructed 
him to wait outside the window for the return of Dhanurdasa, to record his 
reaction.  After some time, Dhanurdasa returned home. At that time, Dhanurdasa 
wife asked him, “Dhanurdasa, is there something wrong at the temple?”
<br>
            “No, my dear. Why?”
            <br>
            “I am worried that they are in need of money, but ashamed to ask for it.  
We must do something to help them.”
<br>
            “What makes you say that?”
            <br>
            “Because one of the devotees from the temple snuck in through the 
window and began taking the jewelry from my body.  I think those poor saints 
must desperately need our help to do something like that.”
<br>
            “What did you do?”
            <br>
            “I turned over, but he fled through the window.”
            <br>
            “Why did you do that?  You scared him away! Now what will we do?”
            <br>
            “I didn't mean to scare him.  I only turned over so that he could take the 
ornaments from the other side of my body as well.”
<br>
br

            Dhanurdasa chastised her saying, “If you were not so affected by false ego, 
you would have given him all your jewels.  Now what will we do? We have failed 
miserably!”
<br>
<br>
            With this, his wife began to lament saying, “You are right. It is only my 
pride that kept me from surrendering everything.  How will we ever make any 
advancement?”
<br>
<br>
            From his hiding place Ramanuja's disciple was astonished at the humility 
and surrender of Dhanurdasa and his chaste wife. When the disciple returned to his 
guru, he reported everything that had taken place.  Ramanuja then explained to 
him the meaning of  both these events—the garments of the sannyasis and the 
jewels of Dhanurdasa's wife:  in this case, the sannyasis were so attached to some 
ragged bits of cloth that they were fighting over them, whereas Dhanurdasa and 
his wife, although grhasthas, were so free from attachment to material things that 
they were ready to have their jewels stolen by the devotees if they were needed for 
the service of the Lord.
<br>
<br>
            In this way, Ramanuja continued to instructed his disciples both by 
example and by precept. His influence on Vaisnavism is powerfully felt to this 
day.  His commentary on Vedanta, the Sri Bhasya  is still considered to be the 
most formidable challenge to the commentary of Sankaracarya.  It is the most 
famous of  the Vaisnava commentaries. Apart from the Sri Bhasya, the most 
important of  Ramanujacarya's works are his commentary on Bhagavad-gita and 
his Vedartha-samgraha, which summarizes the essential Vedic principles. 
According to tradition, Sripad  Ramanujacarya lived to be 100 years old.  His 
disciplic succession continues to this day in maintaining the traditions of Sri 
Vaisnava practice, deity worship and philosophy that he systemized in his 
lifetime.  Ramanujacarya passed away on the tenth day of the waning moon in the  
month of Phalguna, which corresponds to the month of January February on the 
Christian calendar

   <h1 style="color: white;font-size: xx-large; background-color: black; text-align: center;"> Madhcvacharya</h1> 
    According to the Sri Kurma inscriptions of Narahari Tirtha, his direct 
disciple,  Sripad Madhvacarya was born between 1238 and lived for 79 years, until 
1317 A.D. This is confirmed in the Anu-Madhva-Carita. According to the 
authorized biographies compiled by his disciples shortly after his passing away, 
Sripad Madhva was born in the village of Tulunada, which is located about 8 
miles to the southeast of the city of Udipi in Karnataka.  He came from a family of 
sivalli-brahmanas and was the son of Madhyageha Bhatta.  
<br>
<br>
    In his Caitanya Caritamrta commentary (CC Madhya 9.245), Sripad 
Bhakdivedanta Swami comments as follows: “In his childhood, Madhvacarya was 
known as Vasudeva, and there are some wonderful stories surrounding him. It is 
also said that his father piled up many debts, and Madhvacarya converted tamarind 
seeds into actual coins to pay them off. When he was five years old, he was 
offered the sacred thread. A demon named Maniman lived near his abode in the 
form of a snake, and at the age of five, Madvacarya killed that snake with the toe 
of his left foot. When his mother was very disturbed, he would appear before her 
in one jump. He was a great scholar even in childhood, and although his father did 
not agree, he accepted sannyasa at the age of twelve.”
<br>
<br>
     When he was only 12 years old, Madhvacarya left home and accepted the 
renounced order of life, under the guidance of Acyutapreksa, his sannyasa-guru. 
Madhva's sannyasa name was Purnaprajna Tirtha.  His deep study of the scriptures 
was unparalleled, and had convinced him of the uselessness of the Advaita 
interpretation of Vedanta.  He was inspired to revive the original and pure 
interpretation of Vedanta which promotes personal theism. He was to do this on 
the basis of a profound and  innovative interpretation of the scriptures, for which 
he was to become famous. This interpretation is known as Dvaita-dvaita-vada, or 
pure dualism.  
<br>
<br>
    After his initiation, Purnaprajna spent some time in the asrama of 
Acyutapreksa where he carefully studied the Vedanta commentaries of different 
acaryas, beginning with the ^stasiddhi of Vimuktatman. But soon, Purnaprajna's 
expertise in scriptural argument and his determination to establish personal theism 
as the conclusion of Vedanta grew to the point where he could defeat 
Acyutapreksa in argument.  Recognizing Purnaprajna's superior scholarship, 
Acyutapreksa made him the head of his asrama.  Purnaprajna was also awarded 
the title ananda-tirtha, by which he is often referred to in various scriptural 
literatures. 
<br>
<br>
    After he became the temple authority  in the asrama of Acyutapreksa, 
Purnaprajna began training disciples, preaching his interpretation of Vedanta and 
defeating many scholars from different schools of philosophy, including 
Buddhists, Jains, Advaitins, and various impersonalists, agnostics, logicians, and 
the practioners of materialistic religion. His success in defeating all opposing 
scholars inspired him to tour South India in an attempt to preach the philosophy of 
personal theism and devotion to Visnu far and wide.   At this time, he had 
completely formulated all the details of his philosophical system, but had not yet 
committed his system to writing. 
<br>
<br>
    His tour of South India was quite extensive: it took him from Udipi to the 
southernmost tip of India, (Kanyakumari)and from there to Ramesvaram, Sri 
Rangam, and many other important holy places of pilgrimage.  Wherever he went 
he debated the prominent scholars of the impersonal school, smashing their 
interpretations of Vedanta with his brilliant advocacy of dualistic theism. His 
scathing criticisms of Sankaracarya's impersonal Vedanta met with stiff 
opposition, but no one could overcome him in scriptural argument or logical 
debate.  It is said that when Madvha was at Kanyakumari he was challenged by a 
great impersonalist scholar of the Sankara school to write his own commentary on 
Vedanta if he disagreed with the teachings of the master.  At that time, it is said 
that Madhva promised to write his own Vedanta commentary, fully elaborating the 
proper conclusions of personal theism. At Sri Rangam he also expressed a certain 
degree of dissatisfaction with the conclusions of Ramanuja's visistadvaita-vada, in 
that he felt it did not go far enough to refute the dangerous speculative philosophy 
of Sankaracarya.  This further added to the young Madhva's  firm determination to 
someday compose his own commentary incorporating his own unique 
interpretation. 
<br>
<br> 
    After completing his South Indian tour, Madhva decided to tour North 
India as well. With his resolve to complete his own Vedanta commentary growing 
day by day, he was eager to begin the work.  But Madhva wanted to have the 
blessings of the author of Vedanta, Vedavyasa himself, before beginning such an 
ambitious project. He set out for North India and the Himalays, then,  in order to 
achieve the benedictions of Vedavyasa, for it was said that Vyasa, being immortal, 
still resided in his asrama at Badarainatha, although he never made himself visible 
to mortal eyes. 
<br>
<br>
    After a long journey by foot, Sripad Madhva finally arrived at the 
Anantamatha at Badarinatha.  There he remained for seven weeks, absorbed in 
fasting, prayer, and devotional meditation. Inspired from within, he hiked further 
up into the Himalayas, to Badarikasrama, in upper Badari, where Vyasadeva has 
his hermitage. There he met Vedavyasa and explained his commentary on 
Bhagavad-gita to Vyasa himself, who approved. When he met Vyasa, he was 
given a salagrama-sila which is known as Astamurti.  After discussing the 
scriptures with Vyasadeva, Sripad Madhvacarya's understanding of their inner 
meaning became even more profound. He remained at Badarikasrama for some 
months until he finished composing his commentary on Bhagavad-gita, 
whereupon he returned to the Anantamatha. At that time Madhva's companion 
Satya Tirtha wrote down the entire commentary.  At this time, Madhva also wrote 
his commentary on Vedanta.
<br>
<br>  
    Bidding farewell to Badarinatha, Madhva began the long journey home. 
On the way, he again met with and defeated many scholars of various 
philosophical schools.  He traveled through Bihar, Bengal, Orissa, and 
andhradesa.  The Madhva-vijaya describes how when Madhva reached Ganjama, 
on the banks of the river Godavari, hed met two prominent scholars, who were 
well-versed in all the important scriptures: Sobhana Bhatta and Swami Sastri. 
After converting them to his school, these scholars became renowned as important 
followers of Sripad Madhva.  They became famous as Padmanabha Tirtha and 
Narahari Tirtha and are regarded as the principle acaryas of the Madhva school 
after Madhva himself.  Narahari Tirtha is famous for his commentaries on 
Madhva's Gita-bhasya and Karma-nirnaya. He was the Prime Minister of Kalinga 
between 1271 and 1293. Padmanabha Tirtha wrote commentaries on many of 
Madhva's works, including Madhva's Brahma-sutra-bhasya, his Anuvyakhyana, 
and his Dasa-prakaranas. He was the first commentator on many of the major 
works of Madhvacarya. 
<br>
<br>
    After converting Sobhana Bhatta and Swami Sastri, Sripad Madhvacarya 
journeyed through Andhrapradesa, Maharastra and Karnataka arrived at last in 
Udipi. Upon his return to Udipi from North India, Madhva confronted 
Acyutapreksa, who had refused to accept his ideas previously.  Now the roles were 
reversed; guru became disciple and disciple became guru. Madhva converted 
Acyutapreksa from Sankara's Vedanta to the cause of Vaisnavism and accepted 
him as a follower. 
<br>
robust
    As a result of Madhva's success in defeating opposing scholars and gurus, 
his reputation spread, and enthusiasm grew for his new system of  Vedanta 
philosophy. As his commentaries on Bhagavad-gita and Vedanta gained wider and 
wider acceptance, followers and new converts began to join his camp from all over 
India, attracted by his charismatic personality, invincible logic and scriptural 
knowledge, and his inspired faith. 
<br>
<br>
    While he stayed in Udipi, it was Madhva's regular habit to bathe in the 
ocean. One day, he was sitting on the beach absorbed in contemplation upon Sri 
Krsna. At that time, he spotted a ship, bound for Dvaraka, that was about to 
founder on a sand bar. He signaled the ship to safety, and it was able to safely 
approach the shore. The captain of the ship wanted to bestow some present upon 
Sri Madhvacarya, and he accepted a large chunk of gopi-candana tilaka.  As it was 
being presented to the acarya,  the large chunk of tilak broke in half, revealing a 
huge deity of Krsna. Everyone was astonished to find a Krsna deity within the 
block of tilak, but Madhvacarya was not unaccustomed to miracles and accepted it 
as the Lord's grace. At that time he composed some beautiful prayers glorifying 
Sri Krsna, and soon after that the Deity was installed at the temple in Udipi where 
it remains today. The Deity weighed so much that even thirty men had difficulty 
moving it.  Madhva, however, was superhumanly powerful—it is said that he was 
an incarnation of Vayu—and managed to personally carry the Deity to Udipi. 
<br>
<br>
    After installing the Deity of Krsna in Udipi, he revised the system of Deity 
worship, establishing a strict regimen of ceremonial ritual and proper conduct 
among his followers, imposing among other things the rigorous observance of 
fasting on Ekadasis.
<br>
<br>
    Having achieved such great success at home, it was time for Madhva to 
once more travel afar. He began a second pilgrimage to North India, where he 
once again visited Badarikasrama.  The Madhva-vijaya, written by the son of one 
of Madhva's disciples describes how Madhva used his sharp wits, his knowledge 
of many languages such as Turkish and Persian, and his courage to overcome great 
obstacles in his preaching. While on his North Indian tour, Madhva and his 
disciples arrived at a place in the province of Ganga Pradesh where political 
tensions between Hindus and Muslims prevented them from crossing the river. 
The Hindus were on one side of the river and the Muslims on the other side. No 
one dared cross, and no boat was available. Madhva and his followers, without 
regard for the Muslim soldiers who guarded the crossing, swam across the river. 
The entire camp was placed under arrest.  Madhva himself was taken before the 
Muslim King, Sultan Jalal-uddin-Khilji, who demanded an explanation. When 
Madhva was finally allowed to speak on his own behalf, he spoke in Persian, 
addressing the king at length on devotional theism.  Seeing the intensity and 
saintly purity of Sripad Madhvacarya, the Sultan's heart was softened.  So 
impressed was he with Madhva that he wanted to offer him land and money, but 
Madhva set the example of renunciation by humbly declining the Sultan's offer. 
<br>
<br>
    Where wit would not help, Madhva would sometimes use his superhuman 
strength to save a situation. Once his traveling companion and sannyasi disciple 
Satya Tirtha was attacked by a fierce Bengal tiger. Fearless, Madhva went to the 
rescue. After wrestling the tiger away from Satya Tirtha, he sent it away with its 
tail between its legs. Another time, while walking on pilgrimage through a 
dangerous part of India, he was attacked by murderous dacoits, but he easily held 
them off. 
<br>
robust
    Madhva was a multi-faceted personality who lived a long and healthy life. 
He was a natural leader who believed in physical culture as well as intellectual, 
moral, and spiritual culture. He took part in many athletic activities, such as 
wrestling, swimming, and mountain-climbing, which served him well in the 
Himalayas. As he came from a family of brahmanas that had descended from the 
warrior brahmana and incarnation of Godhead, Parasurama, he was tall, strong, 
and robust. It was reputed that there was no limit to his bodily strenghth.  The 
Madhva-vijaya records how a strongman named Kadanjari who was said to have 
the strength of thirty men once challenged Madhvacarya to a contest of strength. 
Madhvacarya placed the big toe of his foot firmly upon the ground and asked 
Kadanjari, the famous strongman, to see if he could lift it. Straining with all his 
brawn again and again, the mighty Kadanjari was unable to move even the big toe 
of Madhvacarya.  According to Trivikrama Pandita, Madhvacarya was endowed 
with all the thirty-two bodily symptoms of a great personality. He had a deep, 
sonorous, and melodic voice and was an expert singer.  His recitation of the verses 
of Srimad-Bhagavatam was regarded as being especially sweet. 
<br>
<br>
    In this way, Madhva traveled extensively throughout the whole of India. 
He returned to South India after having visited Badarinatha, Delhi, Kuruksetra, 
Benares, and Goa. After this, his travels were mostly limited to those provinces of 
South India near Udipi.  After Sankaracarya, who had also traveled extensively, 
He was the second important Vedanta acarya to travel  throughout India, and his 
broad preaching campaign had a lasting effect. Gradually, his following grew, as 
great personalities from all parts of India accepted him as guru.  The Madhva
vijaya mentions that he had disciples from many lands, and his present day 
followers still include the speakers of eight different languages—Tulu, Kannada, 
Konkani, Maratha, Telugu, Southern Saurastri, Bengali, and Hindi.  
<br>
<br>
    After returning to Udipi, Madhva once again immersed himself in prolific 
literary activity. He wrote commentaries on the ten major Upanisads. He wrote ten 
major philosophical treatises, the Dasa-Prakaranas, as well as what many consider 
his most important work, the Anu-Vyakhyana.  He wrote a summary of 
Mahabharata called the Moksa-dharma, and he also commented on Srimad
Bhagavatam. 
<br>
<br>
    Madhvacarya's dedication to the Lord and his deep scholarship made him a 
feared and hated enemy of the followers of Sankaracarya, who had a vested 
interest in maintaining their position as the only bona fide Vedantists. It has been 
said, “Of all the plagues with which mankind is cursed, ecclesiastical tyrrany's the 
worst.”  The tyrrany of the acaryas of the Srngeri-matha founded by Sankaracarya 
led them to attack Sripad Madhva with every means at their disposal.  They 
employed various means to harass the followers of Madhva. They tried to prove 
that Madhva did not come from any authorized disciplic succession. Finally they 
challenged Madhva to a debate.
<br>
<br>
    The Sankarites chose as their champion pandita a highly learned scholar 
named Pundarika Puri, who was famed for his erudition and expertise in argument. 
In the debate with Madhva he was humiliated. In arguing with Madhva Pundarika 
was like a schoolboy facing a professor. Aching for vengeance, the defeated 
pandita arranged for one of his cohorts, a sannyasi named Padma Tirtha, to steal a 
priceless collection of ancient Sanskrit scriptures from the library of Sripad 
Madhvacarya. The books were later recovered with the help of King Jayasimha of 
Kumla. 
<br>
<br>
    After Jayasimha Raja recovered the books of Madhvacarya, an audience 
was arranged between the Jayasimha and Madhva. Their meeting was to be 
followed by a debate between the king's own court pandita and Madhva. The 
pandita, Trivikrama Pandita, a resident of Visnumangala, was the foremost 
authority on impersonal Vedanta in the land of Kumla and an expert poet. They 
met in the temple of Kudil. At the end of the day's discourse, Trivikrama Pandita 
had failed to defeat Madhva, but he refused to surrender.  The debate was 
continued on the following day. The next day, Trivikrama Pandita used all his 
learning, his wit, and his power of argument in an attempt to embarrass Madhva, 
but after exhausting himself was again unable to defeat him. This went on for 
fifteen days, when Trivikrama Pandita, his intellect spent, his doubts destroyed, 
recognized Sri Madhva as his guru. He surrendered to the lotus feet of Sripad 
Madhvacarya and was accepted by him as a disciple. Madhva ordered him to write 
a commentary on Vedanta.  Trivikrama Pandita's commentary is called the Tattva
pradipa.  His conversion was a turning point in Madhva's preaching mission. After 
his conversion, Trivikrama Pandita's own brother and seven other important 
scholars took sannyasa from Madhva and became the first directors of the eight 
Madvhaite monasteries in Udipi. Trivikrama Pandita's son, Narayanacarya who 
later wrote the Madhva-vijaya. 
<br>
<br>
    In the final years of Madhva's life, he wrote further commentaries on the 
scriptures, including the Nyaya-vivarana, the Karma-nirnaya, the Krsnamrta
Maharnava, and others. By this time, Madhvacarya was growing old. He had 
completed what he set out to do.  He had preached his message far and wide, 
elaborated his philosophical system in numerous commentaries, and had many 
trained missionaries who could carry on his work with great energy. He had 
written original works of such a profound character that they would continue to 
influence devotional theism well into the 20th century.  He had established the 
worship of Krsna in Udipi and had given sannyasa to expert scholars and veteran 
preachers such as Padmanabha Tirtha, Narahari Tirtha, Madhava Tirtha, and 
Aksobhya Tirtha, who would succeed him in promoting the philosophical ideals of 
pure dualistic theism.  As he finished his commentary on the Aitereya Upanisad,  
on the verge of his eightieth birthday, Sripad Madhvacarya passed away from this 
world and entered the eternal Vaikuntha planets on the ninth day of the full moon 
in the month of Magh (corresponding to January-February) in the year 1317.
<br>
<br>
    The essential principles of Sri Madhvacarya's teachings—where they run 
parallel to the teachings of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu—have been summarized in 
ten points by Baladeva Vidyabhusana in his Prameya-Ratnavali. These ten points 
are as follows:
<br>
<br>
<h3 style="text-align: center; font: bold;">shri madvhah praha vishnum paratamam akhilamnaya vedyam ca cisvam <br>
    satyam bhedam ca jivam hari carana jusas tartamyam ca tesham  <br>
    moksham vishnv-anghri-labham tad-amala-bhajanam tasya hetum pramanam <br>
    pratyaksadi trayam cety upadisati hari krsna-caitanya chandra</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
"Shri Madhvacaharya taught that: <br>
1) Krishna, who is known as Hari is the Supreme Lord, the Absolute. <br>
2) That Supreme Lord may be known through the Vedas. <br>
3) The material world is real. <br>
4) The jivas, or souls, are different from the Supreme Lord. <br>
5) The jivas are by nature servants of the Supreme Lord. <br>
6) There are two categories of jivas: liberated and illusioned. <br>
7) Liberation means attaining the lotus feet of Krishna, that is, entering into an 
eternal relationship of service to the Supreme Lord. <br>
8) Pure devotional service is the cause of this relationship. <br>
9) The truth may be known through direct perception, inference, and Vedic 
authority. <br>
 <br>

These very principles were taught by Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu."
<br>
In his Caitanya Caritamrta commentary (CC Madhya 9.245), Sripad 
Bhakdivedanta Swami comments: “For further information about Madhvacarya, 
one should read Madhva-vijaya by Narayana Acarya.”

   <h2 style="background-color: black; color: white; text-align: center; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> Shri Baladeva Vidyabhusana</h2> 
         
   <br>
   <br>Shrimad Baladev Vidyabhusan Prabhu was a pure devotee of the highest 
order, who cared for nothing but the service of the Lord.  He didn't have a spot of 
desire for name and fame. He was the composer of many scriptures which are as 
priceless as precious gems, for the ultimate benefit of all those who have taken 
human birth. The exact location of his birth, the names of his mother and father, 
and their family tree is not known.  The exact circumstances of his birth and 
childhood are, therefore, unknown.  Still, some are of the opinion that that he took 
birth in a place called Baleshvara, a village neighboring Remuna, in the early part 
of the 18th century A.D, as the son of a vaisya, an agriculturist.  At an early age he 
became learned in Sanskirt grammar, poetry, rhetoric, and logic.  After becoming 
expert in all these subjects, he began wandering to different places of pilgrimage.  
After wandering about in this way for some time, and after visiting many holy 
places, he happened to stay at a temple of the Tattvavadi followers of Shri 
Madhvacharya.  There, he became fluent in his understanding of the tattvavada
siddhanta, that is, the philosophical and theological conclusions of the followers of 
Madhva. After this, he took sannyasa, and preached the tattvavada-siddhanta very 
vigourously throughout the length and breadth of India. 
<br>
<br>
            As he wandered from one place to the next, he gradually came to 
Jagannatha Puri. .  There he remained and preached for a few days.  At that time, 
he chanced to meet one of the foremost disciples of Shri Rasikananda Deva, 
Pandit Shri Radha-Damodara, with whom he discussed devotional principles. At 
that time, Shrimad Radha-Damodara dev Goswami instructed Baladev on the 
subject of Shri Gourasundara's pastimes of mercy and His teachings on Gaudiya 
Vaishanva siddhanta to Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya.  After hearing the divine 
wisdom spoken by Shri Radha-Damodara Goswami, Baladeva's heart was deeply 
moved.  After a few days of hearing from him, he accepted initiation into the 
Radha-Krishna mantra, and began studying the Sat-Sandarbhas of Jiva Goswami 
at the holy feet of his gurudeva, Radha-Damodara Goswami.
<br>
<br>
            After a short time, Baladeva became expert in the Gaudiya Vaishanva 
siddhanta.  After staying with Radha-Damodara Goswami for some time, he was 
ordered to further his studies in Gaudiya Vaishnavism by going to Vrindavan and 
taking shelter at the holy feet of Vishvanatha Cakravarti Thakura. After first 
visiting Nabadwipa, he soon arrived in Vrindavan. 
<br>
<br>
            Shri Visvanatha Chakravarti Thakur (Shri Harivallabha dasa), was very 
happy to see Baladeva's submission, modesty, learning, and renunciation. From 
that day forward, for some time, he kept Baladeva by his side and taught him the 
acintya-bheda-abheda philosophy of Shri Chaitanya and many other important 
siddhantas related to the Gaudiya Vaishnava conception of Krishna-bhakti. From 
this point on, Shri Baladeva's life and soul was fully dedicated to the theistic 
conception of the Gaudiya Sampradaya.  His mind was fixed on this, and with one
pointed determination, he now began preaching this line to the exclusion of all 
others. 
<br>
<br>
            One day, in Jaipur, in the royal court, the Ramanuja sampradaya began 
arguing a case in connection with the Gaudiya sampradaya. They informed the 
king that the Gaudiya sampradaya had no commentary on the most important 
revealed scripture of Vedic religion—Vedanta; therefore they had no siddhanta 
and no real sampradaya, or school. As a consequence they should give up their 
service of the deities of Govinda and Gopinatha, and entrust with those who were 
bona fide members of a genuine sampradaya. At that time, the king of Jaipura was 
a follower of the Gaudiya sampradaya. He immediately sent word of the 
controversy by messenger to Vishvanatha Cakravarti Thakur in Vrindavan, 
wanting to know if the Gaudiya sampradaya actually did have any commentary on 
theVedanta.  If there was, the king wanted that the commentary be sent 
immediately to Jaipur to satisfy the scrutiny of the pandits from the Ramanuja 
Sampradaya.
<br>
<br> 
            At this time, Shri Vishvanatha Chakravarti was very old and infirm. It was 
impossible for him to  make the arduous journey to Jaipur. He sent his student and 
disciple, Shri Baladev, in his place. Baladeva Vidyabhusan was an expert scholar 
in all the important scriptures. In the midst of a huge assembly of pandits from the 
Ramanuja sampradaya, Baladeva challenged them all to argue with him in 
scholarly debate. A long, and hard-fought debate took place, with tumultuous 
arguing from the Ramanuja school. Still, none of them could stand before his 
conclusive statements, keen scholarship, and penetrating intellect.  Baladeva 
argued that the founder of the Gaudiya Sampradaya, Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu 
established the Shrimad-Bhagavatam as the topmost commentary on Vedanta.  
The Bhagavatam itself claims that it is bhashyanam brahma-sutranam, the natural 
commentary on Vedanta. This is confirmed on the basis of evidence given by Jiva 
Goswami in his Sat Sandarbha. Therefore, the Gaudiya sampradaya has chosen to 
accept Shrimad-Bhagavatam as the original commentary on Vedanta, and sees no 
need for a separate commentary. 
<br>
<br>
            At that point, the pandits from the Ramanuja sampradaya shouted: "He 
admits that there is no commentary! They have no commentary!" Having no other 
recourse, Shri Baladeva Vidyabhusan promised to show them the Gaudiya 
commentary on Vedanta within a few days. The pandits were astonished to think 
that such a thing existed.  They were suspicious that this might be some kind of 
trick, but were silenced for the time being.
<br>
<br>
            Very troubled within his mind, Shri Baladeva Vidyabhusana went to the 
temple of Shri Govinda, the deity of Rupa Goswami. After offering his eightfold 
obeisances before the deity, he related everything that had taken place. That night 
in a dream, Shri Govinda told him, you must compose the commentary.   That 
commentary will be personally sanctioned by me. No one will be able to find any 
fault in it.  Seeing this in his dream, Baladeva became very happy, and his heart 
was full of strength, ready for the task at hand. After this, he meditated on the 
lotus feet of Govinda and began writing his commentary.  Within a few days it 
was completed. This commentary became known as the Govinda Bhashya 
commentary on Vedanta.
<br>
<br>
            In an addendum appended to the Govinda Bhashya, after it was published, 
Shri Baladeva has written, vidyarupam bhushanam ye pradaya, khatim nitye teno 
yo mamudarah, Shri govinda-svapna-nirdishtha bhashye, radhabandhurangah sa 
jiyat.  "May Shri Govinda be all glorious.  By his mercy, he  revealed this 
commentary to me in a dream. The commentary revealed by him is especially 
appreciated by the highly learned, and as a result of this  I have been given the 
name Vidyabhushan, but it is Shri Govinda who deserves all credit. May that Shri 
Govinda who is the most dear life and soul of  Shri Radhika,  be all-victorious." 
<br>
<br>
            With the Govinda Bhashya commentary in hand, Baladeva Vidyabhushan 
arrived at the assembly hall of the king, where the pandits were waiting for him. 
When he showed them his commentary, they were speechless. The Gaudiya 
sampradaya was proclaimed victorious.  The king and all the Gaudiya Vaishnavas 
were supremely happy.  At that time the pandits gave Shri Baladeva the name 
"Vidyabhushana," or one whose ornament is knowledge, in honor of his great 
scholarship.  The year was 1628, Shaka era. From the day forward, the king of 
Jaipur decreed, everyone would attend the aroti of Shri Govinda, the deity beloved 
by the Gaudiya Vaishnavas, who was ultimately responsible for such a wonderful 
commentary on Vedanta. 
<br>
<br>
            The Ramanuja pandits, falling under the influence of Shri Baladeva 
Vidyabhusana, accepted him as their acharya and wanted to become his disciples. 
With great humility, Baladeva Vidyabhushana refused, explaining that there are 
four sampradayas, among which the Shri Sampradaya is a genuine school that 
preaches servitude to God as the best religious process. By advancing the views of 
the Gaudiya sampradaya, he meant no disrespect to the Shri sampradaya.  To 
insult the Shri sampradaya would be a great offense, he said.
<br>
<br>
            Shripad Baladeva Vidyabhushan returned from Jaipur to Vrindavan 
carrying the message of his victory.  Upon returning, he submitted to the lotus feet 
of Shri Vishvanatha Chakravarti Thakura and told him the news. All the visiting 
Vaishnavas and the residents of Vrindavan were delighted, and Vishvanatha 
Chakravarti Thakura bestowed his blessings upon Baladeva Vidyabhusana. 
<br>
<br>
            After this, Baladeva Vidyabhusana began writing a commentary on the Sat 
Sandarbha. Soon Vishvanatha Chakravarti Thakura passed away, and the 
Vaishnava community felt as if a great beacon of divine light had been 
extinguished. At that time, Shri Baladeva Vidyabhusan became regarded among 
the Vaishnava community as the keeper of the flame, the leader among those who 
understood the teachings of Shri Chaitanya.
<br>
<br>
            In his teachings, Baladeva establishes the transcendental position of the 
Vedas, and then argues that they are the best evidence for knowing the supreme 
truth. In his Siddhanta-darpana, Baladeva has explained the position of 
transcendental sound in relationship to Krishna and his holy name as follows:
<br>
 <h3 style="text-align: center; font: bold;">ekameva pram tattvam vachyavachaka bhavabhak <br>
    vachyah sarveshvaro devo vachakah pranavobhavet <br>
    matsya-kurma-adibhir-rupair-yatha vachyo bahur-bhavet <br>
    vachako'pi tatharthadi-bhavadbahur-udiryate <br>
    adyantarahitatvena svayam nityam prakirtite <br>
    avirbhava tirobhavau syatamasya yugeyuge</h3>
    <br>
            "The one absolute truth has two categories: the named (Krishna) and the 
name (Om). Parameshvara, Shri Krishna, the absolute person is the named; 
pranava, or omkara (Om) is the name. The named, or Parameshvara Shri Krishna, 
reveals himself in different forms as Matsya, Kurma, and many other forms. In the 
same way the name of the Supreme Lord expands into many different forms; such 
as the transcendental syllable Om, the gayatri mantram, and the Vedas themselves. 
There is no limit to the Supreme Personality of Godhead; he has no beginning and 
no end. As a consequence, his glorification is also eternal.  He appears within this 
material world, stays for some time, and again disappears according to his own 
sweet will."
<br>
<br>
            Baladev explains the potency of Godhead in his Siddhanta-darpana: "The 
Lord has three potencies—thinking (jnana) feeling (kriya) and willing (bala). 
Through these three potencies he causes the material creation to come into being. 
The rays of consciousness emanating from him—the jiva souls—are his separated 
parts and parcels. By his thinking, feeling, and willing, they too come into being. 
The Vedas are spoken by the Lord, who is all-perfect.  The Vedas are therefore 
free from the four defects of material existence: error, cheating, illusion, and 
imperfect perception.  And so, the Vedas are the perfect form of evidence for 
understanding the Supreme Truth. The Vedas glorify Krishna as the absolute 
truth.  The Puranas and Itihasas are as good as the Vedas.  They too glorify 
Krishna as the absolute truth."
<br>
<br>
            In his Vedanta-samantaka, Baladev has expanded on this thesis of the 
Vedas being the best evidence for understanding the Supreme Godhead. There he 
says: <br>
tadevam sarvatah shreishtha shabdasya sthite tattvanirnayakastu 
shrotilakshana eva na tvarshalakshanopi.
<br>
<br> "There are different ways of knowing 
what is truth: pratyaskha,direct perception, anuman,  inference, hypothesis, and 
deduction, shabda, the words of the authorities arthapati, interpretation, 
anupalabdhi, negative inference, sambhava, the laws of probability, and aitihya, 
history.  Of all these  methods of arriving at truth, shabda, hearing from 
authorities, is best.  The best source of knowledge about the absolute is the shruti: 
revealed truth received from Vedic authority.  Different scholars always entertain 
different opinions about reality, but the Vedic shastras are eternal and 
transcendental, moreover they are free from the four defects of material existence, 
having sprung directly from the Supreme Lord Himself. therefore they are the best 
evidence for knowing the absolute truth. " (Vedanta Samantaka 1/51)
<br>
<br>
            What has been proved on the basis of solid evidence, pramana, is called 
prameya. Baladev has written a book called Prameya Ratnavali, in which he states 
nine principles that he has established are facts, proven by the incontrovertible 
evidence of the Vedas. The teachings of Madhva-Gaudiya Vaishnavism as it has 
descended from Madhvacharya to Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu have been 
summarised in the Prameya Ratnavali. 
<br>
<br>His nine principles are stated in the 
following verse (PR 8): <br>
<h3 style="text-align: center; font: bold;">shri madvhah praha vishnum paratamam akhilamnaya vedyam ca cisvam <br>
    satyam bhedam ca jivam hari carana jusas tartamyam ca tesham  <br>
   moksham vishnv-anghri-labham tad-amala-bhajanam tasya hetum pramanam <br>
    pratyaksadi trayam cety upadisati hari krsna-caitanya chandra</h3> 
    <br>
 "Shri Madhvacaharya taught that: <br>
 1) Krishna, who is known as Hari is the Supreme Lord, the Absolute. <br>
 2) That Supreme Lord may be known through the Vedas. <br>
 3) The material world is real. <br>
 4) The jivas, or souls, are different from the Supreme Lord. <br>
 5) The jivas are by nature servants of the Supreme Lord. <br>
 6) There are two categories of jivas: liberated and illusioned. <br>
 7) Liberation means attaining the lotus feet of Krishna, that is, entering into an 
eternal relationship of service to the Supreme Lord. <br>
 8) Pure devotional service is the cause of this relationship. <br>
 9) The truth may be known through direct perception, inference, and Vedic 
authority. <br>
 These very principles were taught by Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu."
 <br>
 <br>
            According to Baladeva there are five categories of tattvas or truths which 
constitute reality: ishvara, God; jiva, soul; prakriti, matter; kala, time; and karma, 
action. Ishvara, or God, is the greatest.  He is all-knowing, he is the utmost 
realization of transcendental bliss, and his very nature is ecstasy. He is full in all 
qualities and is the absolute person. He is the master of everything, and is eternally 
free from birth and death. He is the master of all the gods headed by Brahma and 
Shiva. He is the supreme husband, the Lord of lords, and the Supreme Person, the 
worthiest of receiving prayers.  He alone remains as the absolute truth even after 
this material world (which is his separated material energy) is destroyed along 
with all the demigods such as Brahma, Shiva, and Indra. 
<br>
<br>
            Baladeva further explains that Krishna has three energies, parashakti, 
kshetrajna-shakti, and maya-shakti. Parashakti means svarupa-shakti, or the Lord's 
internal potency.  Kshetrajna-shakti means jiva-shakti, or the living beings, and 
maya-shakti means the Lord's external potency, his potency for keeping the souls 
in illusion. This explanation is on the basis of the Vishnu Purana.  He goes on to 
explain that there is no difference between the body and soul of God. They are one 
and the same.  As Krishna, the Supreme Lord has two hands, he plays a flute, he 
has a transcendental form of eternity, knowledge, and bliss, and he is known by 
the names Govinda and Gopal.  Lakshmidevi is nondifferent from him, in that he 
is the Supreme Energetic and She is His Supreme Energy.  (sei jaganmata lakshmi 
vishnur anapayini shakti) This confirmed throughout the shastra. Whatever form 
the lord appears in, there is a corresponding Lakshmi form who acts as his eternal 
consort.   When the Lord appears as a god, Lakshmi appears as a goddess.  When 
the Lord advents as an ordinary human being, Lakshmi also descends upon this 
earth as an ordinary human being. Baladeva Vidyabhushan says: teshu sarveshu 
lakshmi-rupeshu radhayah svayam laksmitvam mantavyam sarveshu bhagavad
rupeshu krishnasya svayam bhagavatvavat: (Vedanta-samantaka 2.37) Of all the 
manifestations of Lakshmidevi, Shrimati Radharani is the Supreme Goddess, just 
as amongst so many avatars of Godhead, Krishna is the supreme Personality of 
Godhead.  This is confirmed in the Brihad-Gautamiya Tantra,which states, "Shri 
Radhika is the Supreme Goddess. Her very nature is Krishna, for her very 
existence is permeated by Krishna.  Therefore she is known as Krishnamayi, or 
one who is full of Krishna. She is known as Paradevata, for she is the Supreme 
Goddess. All other goddesses are subordinate to her. She is the Supreme Lakshmi 
and her transcendental effulgence surpasses all conceptions of brilliance. She is 
the supreme enchantress, for she enchants Krishna Himself, who is capable of 
charming millions of cupids."
<br>
<br>
            Baladev cites Shaunaka Muni who says in Shrimad-Bhagavatam that of all 
the avatars, expansions of Godhead, and Personalities of Godhead, Krishna is the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. The worship of Krishna, must therefore be 
regarded as the highest form of worship. 
<br>
<br>
            According to Baladeva, the jiva souls are the atomic spiritual energy of the 
Lord. The souls are eternal and can never be destroyed by any means. The soul's 
true eternal nature is to be filled with transcendental knowledge: sa ca jivo 
bhagavadaso mantavyah dasabhuto harereva nanyasyaive kadacaneti padmat 
(Vedanta-samantaka 3.11) "It is the constitutional nature of the soul to be a 
servant of Bhagavan Shri Krishna. It is the version of the Padma-Purana that the 
soul is an eternal servant of Hari, and has no other genuine position." By surrender 
to the lotus feet of a spiritual master who is a devotee of Krishna,one attain 
Krishna-bhakti by the guru's mercy. Upon attaining Krishna-bhakti one gets 
Krishna Himself.
<br>
<br>
            In His Vedanta-samantaka, Shri Baladeva Vidyabhusana offers the 
following prayer to the lotus feet of his gurudeva, Shri Radha-Damodara 
Goswami:
<br>
<h3 style="text-align: center; font: bold;">
    <br>
    radhadidamodara nama vibhrata <br>
    viprena vedantamayah syamantaka <br>
    shri radhikayairviniveditomaya <br>
    tasyah pramodam sa tanotu sarvada</h3> 
    <br>
    <br>
 Having been deputed to do so by my gurudeva, the brahmana named Shri Radha
Damodara Goswami, I have compiled this commentary on the Vedanta known as 
Vedanta-syamantaka for the sake of Shrimati Radharani's pleasure.  This 
commentary is a summary of the important points of Vedanta. May it be pleasing 
to  Shri Radhika. 
<br>
<br>
            Shri Baladeva Vidyabhusana had two superexcellent disciples who were 
perfected souls. Their names were Shri Uddhava Dasa and Shri Nandana Mishra. 
<br>
Among the books compiled by Shri Baladeva Vidyabhusana were as follows:  <br>
            His commentary on Vedanta called the Govinda-bhashya; the "jewel of 
conclusions" or Siddhanta Ratna; Sahitya Kaumudi; a summary of Vedanta 
philosophy known as Vedanta Syamantaka; the "jewel of factual principles" 
(outline the nine principles held in common by both the Madhva and Chaitanya 
schools) known as Prameya Ratnavali; a summary of Gaudiya Vaishnava 
principles called the Siddhanta Darpana; the Kavya Kaustubha (a book of selected 
Sanskrit verses for Vaishnavas); the Aishvarya Kadambini; Vyakarana Kaumudi 
(a book on grammar); Padakaustubha (selected prayers); commentaries on 
important Upanishads beginning with the Isha Upanishad and including the 
Gopala Tapani Upanishad; a commentary on Bhagavad-gita known as 
Gitabhushana Bhashya; as well as commentaries on: Vishnu-Sahasra-nama,  
Shrimad-Bhagavatam (Vaishnava-nandini-tika), Jiva Goswami's Tattva
Sandarbha, Rupa Goswami's Stavamala, Nata-chandrika, Jayadeva Goswami's 
Chandraloka, his own Sahitya Kaumudi, Laghu-bhagavatamrita, Nataka
Chandrika, and Shyamananda Shataka.
